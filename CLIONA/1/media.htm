<h2 style="text-align:center">Media Elements</h2><p>Audio and/or video clips may be found in some of our courses labeled, "A Premium Course".</p><br/>
<p>Each video segment allows you to select a low or high bandwidth presentation.  Low bandwidth will present audio with still shots.  High bandwidth will present video with sound.  To run the video optimally, you should have access to a wi-fi, broadband or high-speed internet connection (network, cable, DSL or fiber).</p><br/>
 </div><p>If you select "high bandwidth” but experience excessively long download times or jerkiness while the video is running, you may not have enough bandwidth (slow speed or too much traffic online) to view the video.  You should stop the video and select the "low bandwidth” option.</p><br/><p>A transcript for all audio and video segments is available for every course.</p><br/>
