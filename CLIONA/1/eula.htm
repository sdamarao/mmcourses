If any item of Software fails to comply with the warranties set forth in (a) or (b) above, MicroMash will use reasonable efforts to correct the noncompliance (e.g., by furnishing a modification or replacement); provided that MicroMash is able to reproduce the noncompliance (if the Software was sent to you on recordable media, You will return the item together with a copy of Your paid invoice to MicroMash [c/o MicroMash Technical Support at the MicroMash address set forth in the documentation included within this Software]); and If after the expenditure of such reasonable efforts MicroMash is unable to correct the noncompliance, MicroMash may refund You an equitable portion of the compensation paid by You for this Software, in which event such refund will be in full satisfaction of all Your claims relating to such noncompliance.
If the Software fails to comply with the warranty set forth in (c) above, MicroMash will defend and indemnify You against any claim asserted in any judicial proceedings against You based on such noncompliance, provided that You notify MicroMash of such proceeding promptly after You receive notice thereof, MicroMash has exclusive control over the defense and settlement of the proceeding, and You provide such assistance in defense and settlement (including compliance with any court order or settlement) of the proceeding as MicroMash may reasonably request.
