<p>When using the adjusted net assets method for valuing land and a factory building, the land is valued separately from the improvements. The land should be valued at its highest and best use.</p>

<div id="divwrap6DescText" style="display:none;"><p>If you were to value a small restaurant located on two lots in the middle of a crowded office district, the highest and best use of the land may be for a parking ramp. It is for this use that the land valuation will be based.</p>
</div>
</div><p>When valuing the improvements, the valuation needs to take into consideration allowances for functional obsolescence, physical deterioration, and economic or external obsolescence. The total value for the real estate being valued would be the sum of the fair market value of the land and the improvements. The use of a professional real estate appraiser probably will be necessary to help in the determination of the fair market value. In fact, business valuations often require a team approach since the individual preparing the valuation often is not an expert in establishing land, building, and/or equipment values. SSVS No. 1 provides guidelines for the CPA when enlisting the services of other professionals such as real estate appraisers or equipment appraisers in the course of a business valuation.</p>
