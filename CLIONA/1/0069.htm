<p>Other national economic data that could have a close relationship to business trends in an industry could include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gross national product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gross domestic product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consumer price index</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disposable personal income</p>
</li>
<li><p>Durable goods expenditures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unemployment rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interest rates/monetary policy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all economic indicators will affect all companies. Through discussions with the business owner(s) and a study of the industry of which the company is a part, the valuator can generally determine which economic indicators might provide a potential cause and effect relationship regarding sales and/or growth of the subject company.</p>
<p>Regional economic issues are also factors. For example, when valuing an optical shop in a small community, it would be important to know that the largest employer in the area was closing its doors. In conjunction with regional issues, it is also important to be aware of how the subject company compares to the competition. Does the subject company command a large market share compared to competitors, or is it less able to compete in the current market?</p>
<p>Knowledge of the product is also important. If the business being valued produces a &#8220;fad&#8221; product and has no other products in the pipeline, insight into the lifecycle of that product would be important.</p>
