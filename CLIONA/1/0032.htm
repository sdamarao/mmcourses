<h3>Identification of assets</h3>
<p>It is not unusual for an important marital asset to be a closely held business. As a general rule, at the dissolution of a marriage, a small, family run business is not divided between the spouses. One spouse will receive the business in the distribution of marital assets, and the other spouse will receive other assets of equal value. Obviously, a value for the business in question must be obtained and agreed upon by the two parties before the distribution of the assets can take place.</p>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>caution</b></span></p>
<p>Because divorce is covered by state laws, it is important for the individual preparing the business valuation to be aware of the definition of the standard of value in the state where the valuation is prepared. For example, goodwill and the inclusion of a covenant not to compete will be included in the definition of value for a closely held business in some states, not in others.</p>

<h3>Estate planning</h3>
<p>The IRS will require a valuation of a nonpublicly traded business upon the death of the owner(s), for estate-tax purposes. As a practitioner, it is wise to suggest to clients who own such businesses that they obtain periodic valuations so that planning can be done to minimize the ultimate estate tax. The IRS is also more likely to accept the estate valuation when it has been done on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As part of estate planning, it is not unusual for business ownership to be passed on to the younger generations during the owner's lifetime. The IRS will require a proper valuation of such a gift. In the same light, charitable contributions of ownership in a closely held business need documentation to support the value of that donation.</p>
