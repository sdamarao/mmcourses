<p>There are also non-tax purposes for preparing a <a title="Glossary Term:Business Valuation" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/pf40.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">business valuation</a>. The potential purchaser of a closely held business may wish to have a formal valuation prepared as a guide in determining the maximum offer that he will be willing to make. This potential purchaser will have a set of investment criteria that includes the investment value of the purchase. This is the value that an investor places on a business, taking into consideration projected income, projected cash flow, and risk.</p>
<p>The value of the investment is based upon the risk of holding the investment and the expected earnings due to potential synergies inherent in the investment. For example, the purchase of a distribution center could provide a great deal of synergy for a manufacturer of machine parts. Also, in a buy/sell situation, the seller could possess a higher level of knowledge about the closely held business than the typical investor, resulting in the use of intrinsic value as the valuation method.</p>
<p>On the other side, the seller may wish to have a formal valuation prepared as a guide in determining the minimum offer that she will be willing to accept. The seller may also approach the valuation process through the use of intrinsic and/or investment value as well as fair market value-what buyers are willing to pay. Business transactions occur within a larger framework guided by market conditions. For example, if there are numerous medical practices for sale in an area at a given time, it would be considered a &#8220;buyer's market&#8221; since, if a seller is motivated for personal reasons to sell quickly, that individual would be willing to accept a lower amount for the sale of a business. On the flip side, if a &#8220;seller's market&#8221; exists, buyers are often willing to pay the seller's intrinsic value.</p>
