<p>When there are operating and nonoperating assets, returns from both types of assets must be considered. Except in the case of liquidation, the value is generally based on an expected future return since the business investor, like any other investor, is purchasing the right to future earnings.</p>
<p>To find potential guideline firms, it is necessary to obtain financial information about the firms that might be comparable. Finding such companies is an easier job today than just a number of years ago:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>First, there are a larger number of publicly traded companies to choose from.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Second, there are more small companies being traded on the open market&#8212;particularly NASDAQ&#8212;and smaller companies tend to be more comparable to closely held companies.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Third, many data sources have been developed that can facilitate obtaining basic financial information about these firms&#8212;and help the analyst determine the necessary discount for lack of marketability and the control premium.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>There are numerous resources available to aid the business valuator when searching for potential guideline organizations. For example, databases available over the Internet&#8212;or published on various optical storage media (e.g., CDs, or DVDs)&#8212;can provide historical information of five years or more for thousands of publicly traded firms along with the capacity of developing individual and aggregate ratios for a chosen group of firms or by industry. Other databases provide information on private firms; however, such records must be used with extreme caution since accuracy and/or consistency may be lacking. There is a great deal of data available, making the search for potential guideline organizations much easier than in the past.</p>
