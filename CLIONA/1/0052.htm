<h3>Income approach</h3>
<p>Many investors are not satisfied with only a two- or three-percent return on invested funds. These investors may wish to purchase stock in a publicly traded organization. Because an investment in stock is riskier than a certificate of deposit, investors will require a higher rate of return to compensate for the risk of the stock investment.</p>
<p>The income-oriented approaches to business valuation are based on the theory that an investor will require an investment to yield a return sufficient to recover the initial cost of the investment, as well as provide a return sufficient to compensate for the perceived risk of that investment. In other words, the higher the perceived risk, the higher the expected return required to attract potential investors. This return comes in the form of future earnings. It is reasonable to assume that the actual or expected earnings and/or cash flows of a closely held business are critical components when determining a value for such an organization</p>
<p>Because future net cash inflows are used to determine a value for the subject organization when using an income-oriented approach to business valuation, it is important that the company be a going concern that is expected to have a positive future income-producing capacity. This method incorporates the theory of discounted cash flows.</p>
<p>Future net cash inflows are projected, and then those net cash inflows are discounted to a present value using an appropriate discount rate reflecting the degree of risk involved in the investment proposal. These income based approaches require a thorough analysis of revenues, costs, capital assets, capital structure, the industry, the national and/or international economy, and the region in which the company operates in order to develop a realistic forecast of future net cash inflows. The analyst is also required to choose appropriate capitalization and/or discount rates to reflect the risk of the investment.</p>
