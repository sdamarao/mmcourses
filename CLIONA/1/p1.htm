<h2>Investments</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg2_20.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Today, investors have a wide variety of investment alternatives, including financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds), commodities, real estate, and collectibles (such as artwork and rare coins). The investor's purchasing and selling decisions for these investments generally are based on the expectation of the possible returns that could be received&#8212;sometime in the future&#8212;for funds invested today. These possible returns are relative to the perceived riskiness of the investment. Hundreds of millions of shares of stock&#8212;and billions of dollars in bonds of publicly held corporations&#8212;are traded daily, providing nearly instantaneous information as to the market value of these assets.</p>
<p>This works well with publicly traded companies, but how does an investor determine the market value of an ownership interest in a closely held business whose stock is not exchanged on public markets?</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Defining the Business Valuation</h2>
<p>On any given day, the value of investments sold on a public market can easily be determined. For example, if an individual held 10 shares of stock in <i>The Dover Company</i> on the date of his death that were selling for $50 per share on the open market, the IRS would determine the value of that investment would be $500 ($50 per share &#215; 10 shares) for estate tax purposes.</p>
<p>But what about the over 90% of the businesses in the United States that are closely held companies whose stock is not traded on public markets? The value for all or part of these organizations can be determined:</p>

<p>As an aid in developing buy/sell agreements</p>

<p>To help courts determine an equitable division of property in a divorce settlement</p>
<br/>

<p>To establish value for estates and for gift tax purposes</p>
<br/>

<p>To establish value in litigated situations</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/dollarbill_on.gif" alt="dollarbill image"/>
<p>To establish value for mergers and reorganizations</p>
<br/>
<p>According to the definition in the <i>International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms</i> that appears in Appendix B of the <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i>, (SSVS No. 1) a business valuation is &#8220;the act or process of determining the value of a business enterprise or ownership interest therein.&#8221; (International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms, June 2001)</p>

<h2>The History of Valuations</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_1a_4.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>In the 1920s, the 18th Amendment was passed (prohibition), and businesses producing or serving alcoholic beverages&#8212;that were forced to close&#8212;had to calculate the value of their businesses in order to determine their losses for IRS purposes. Since there were numerous closely held organizations that would be reporting losses related to prohibition, the IRS provided valuation guidelines in a series of Appeals and Review Memorandums (ARMs) and Revenue Rulings. Revenue Ruling 59-60 presented a general approach for valuation. This ruling provided a general valuation method and list of factors to be considered in valuing shares of stock of closely held corporations for estate- and gift-tax purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Revenue Ruling 59-60 (issued in 1959)</h3>
<p>Estate and gift taxes are only two reasons for determining the value of a closely held corporation. Revenue Ruling 59-60 provides a basis for <i>all</i> valuations. The methods discussed in this revenue ruling relate to valuing stock where market quotations are unavailable or occur so infrequently that they do not reflect fair market value. The same valuation principles presented in Revenue Ruling 59-60 for closely held corporations can be applied to unincorporated businesses. Revenue Ruling 59-60 defines a closely held corporation in Section 2 of its ruling.</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>Closely held corporations are those corporations the shares of which are owned by a relatively limited number of stockholders. Often the entire stock issue is held by one family. The result of this situation is that little, if any, trading in the shares takes place. There is, therefore, no established market for the stock and such sales as occur at irregular intervals seldom reflect all of the elements of a representative transaction as defined by the term &#8220;fair market value.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;2.03</p>

<h2>Berg v. Commissioner</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img1.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>In 1991, there was a landmark court case regarding business valuation&#8212;<i>Estate of Edgar A Berg v. Commissioner (T.C. Memo 1991-279)</i>. The two CPAs who provided the valuation for the Berg Estate were in academia. They did not have formal education in the area of business valuation, were not members of a business valuation or appraisal organization, and only made passing reference to a prior court case as support for their business valuation result. On the other hand, the IRS expert did have training in business valuation and used recognized studies of comparables to support the assets being valued. Until this time, the courts would often use the average of the business valuations presented by each side. However, in the <i>Berg</i> case, the court chose the IRS's position, since the report provided by its expert was comprehensive, logical, supported, and well presented. This case marked a change in how business valuations were approached, and it highlighted the importance of the background and education of the valuation analyst.</p>

<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>New standards for business valuation</h2>
<p>In 2001, the AICPA began to develop a set of standards that defined the business valuation process and reporting. Over a period of six years, individuals from various AICPA committees&#8212;along with other experts in the business valuation and accounting fields&#8212;participated in the development of an Exposure Draft. The draft was issued in 2005 and then revised based upon comments received from professionals actively working in the business valuation area. A second draft was published in 2006.</p>
<p>On June 21, 2007, the AICPA issued the <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1, Valuation of a Business, Business Ownership Interest, Security, or Intangible Asset</i>. Per the AICPA's news release:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>The AICPA developed the valuation standard to improve the consistency and quality of practice among its members who perform engagements that estimate values for various reasons .&#160;.&#160;. Congress, government agencies, and accounting regulators have recently focused their attention on appraisal issues&#8212;such activity shows the importance of valuation to the business community and individuals. In addition, an increasing number of CPAs offer valuation services. The standard promotes greater transparency and provides our members with a set of guidelines in the unique context of a CPA practice.</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_1a_8.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Unlike the situation in <i>Berg</i>, CPAs now have guidelines to use when performing a business valuation from the time of the acceptance of the engagement, the gathering of data, the development of a value, and finally, the writing of the report. By following the standards set in this statement, the valuation analyst will gain credibility in the legal setting and the business community at large. The <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i> (SSVS No. 1) is effective for all business valuations accepted on or after January 1, 2008, that are prepared by members of the AICPA. The statement can be downloaded as a PDF file from the AICPA's website. Any CPA involved with valuation engagements needs to be familiar with the contents of SSVS No. 1 and follow the steps outlined in the statement.</p>
<p>In addition, both the AICPA and NACVA (National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts) have developed rigorous certification programs with continuing education requirements for CPAs preparing business valuations. These programs include written, proctored examinations, and involvement with business valuations under the tutelage of a qualified individual before certification is granted. These programs have allowed certified individuals to support their claims that they are &#8220;experts&#8221; in business valuation.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>As with any type of consulting engagement, a CPA accepting a valuation engagement needs to have the following:</p>

<img src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
<p>They must have <i>Professional Competence</i> and accept only engagements that the individual (or firm) can expect to complete with the required specialized proficiency. A business valuation certification as well as the required CPE necessary to retain those certifications provides a CPA with the basis for the necessary competency.</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
<p>They must perform all business valuations with <i>Due Professional Care</i>. SSVS No. 1 provides an outline of the steps necessary when executing a business valuation.</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
<p>They must <i>Plan and Supervise</i> the business valuation in an adequate fashion. Again, SSVS No. 1 provides a guideline to help accomplish these goals.</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
<p>They must obtain <i>Sufficient Relevant Data</i> to support the determination of value. SSVS No. 1 clearly spells out the type of information that is necessary to support a calculated or conclusion of value.</p>

<p>The following are some examples of business value definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Net book value</b>: The difference between assets (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization) and liabilities as they appear on the balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Liquidation value</b>: The net amount that is expected to be received from the sale of an organization's assets and the settlement of its debts. Liquidation can be conducted in either a forced or orderly fashion resulting in different ultimate values.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Investment value</b>: The value that a particular investor places on a business, taking into consideration projected income, projected cash flow, and risk. In other words, the analyst is concerned about the real value of the asset that can be determined only with a higher level of knowledge than the typical investor about the item being valued. For example, the real value of an asset may be different than the price exchanged between a willing buyer and a willing seller since the focus is on a particular investor.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Intrinsic value</b>: The value that is placed on a business, taking into consideration projected income, projected cash flow, and risk as interpreted by an analyst. In other words, the analyst is concerned about the real value of the asset that can be determined only with a higher level of knowledge than held by the typical investor about the item being valued. For example, the real value of an asset may be different than the current market value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Market value</b>: A type of value, stated as an opinion, that presumes the transfer of property (i.e., a right of ownership or a bundle of such rights), as of a certain date, under specific conditions set forth in the definition of the term identified by the appraiser as applicable in an appraisal. (USPAP 2016-2017 Edition, Definitions, p.3, Lines 92-94)</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Going concern value</b>: The value of a business enterprise that is expected to continue to operate into the future. The value created in a company as the result of intangibles, such as an expert workforce or a loyal, established customer base, are part of the going concern value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Fair market value</b>: The amount for which a business would exchange hands given a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable about the relevant facts of the transaction, are under no compulsion to enter into the transaction, and have no special relationship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p><br/>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Fair Market Value</h3>
<p>Fair market value is a concept that is used by courts and the IRS to settle disputed estate- and gift-tax issues. However, this concept is seldom used by a willing seller and a willing buyer. Transactions between third parties generally involve a negotiation process. As such, <i>value</i> is defined by what the seller is willing to accept and the buyer is willing to pay. For a business with above-average earnings for its industry, a buyer is often willing to pay a premium over the potential selling price of an average firm. If adverse economic conditions exist, a seller may be forced to accept a discounted sales price. Since many business valuations are prepared for purposes other than the actual sale to a third party, the concept of fair market value as defined by the courts and the IRS is extremely important.</p>
<p>For estate-tax purposes (Reg. &#167;20.2031-1(b)) and for gift-tax purposes (Reg. &#167;25.2512-1), fair market value is defined as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Key Term</h2>
<p>The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, both parties having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. (Reg. &#167;20.2031-1(b)) Court decisions often assert that these hypothetical parties are able, as well as willing, to trade, and are <i>well-informed</i> about the property and the market for such property.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, both the buyer and the seller have informed knowledge about the particular business being valued, the industry, the national and regional economy, and any other pertinent facts related to the company and the environment in which it operates.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Elements of Fair Market Value</h3>
<p>Looking closely at the definition of fair market value, the important elements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There must be two unrelated parties involved&#8212;a hypothetical willing buyer and a hypothetical willing seller. Neither party is under any compulsion to buy or sell. Both are free to walk away from any negotiated deal that is not satisfactory to them. Note that the seller and buyer are &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; and not specific, and the characteristics of this hypothetical buyer or seller are not necessarily the same as the characteristics of an actual buyer or seller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both parties must have reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. Both parties are aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the business in question. They are also knowledgeable about the industry and the economy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These facts are used to predict a future which is neither unreasonably pessimistic nor unreasonably optimistic. Fair market value is agreeable to both sides, given that both parties want to make the best deal possible. In other words, the fair market value is the most probable selling price, as opposed to the highest or lowest negotiated price.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is the price upon which the intelligent and reasonable buyer and seller would agree. Neither party has an advantage over the other in knowledge, understanding of the issues, or legal or technical resources. In other words, a level playing field exists.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is determined for a specific valuation date, and the hypothetical seller and buyer do not have knowledge about unforeseeable future events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is considered to be the highest and best use of the property and not necessarily the value related to how the property is currently used. For example, land currently may be used for farming. The best use of the property, however, may be for a large retail establishment. In such a case, the land should be valued for use as a retail establishment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Fair Value</h3>
<p>Another important definition of value is Fair Value. Per FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 (ASC 820), fair value is</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>.&#160;.&#160;.the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. (FASB ASC 820-10-20)</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>When determining fair value, it is assumed that the value measurement is being made for a particular asset, liability, or equity ownership given its specific attributes, age and condition, location, possible restrictions on sale, and ability to stand alone or need to function as a group.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b>To view this interactivity please view chapter 1, page 18</b></p><p style="font-size: 10pt" face="Verdana"><b>Interactivity information:</b><br/>
<p>The three important components included in the definition of fair value that are important to understand are:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p><b>Price:</b> The hypothetical transaction is assumed to have occurred in an orderly fashion. In other words, the holder of the asset or liability is able to take advantage of normal market activities for the transaction in question. The item being valued is considered to be exposed to the market for an appropriate amount of time prior to the measurement date. Furthermore, this is not a sale made under conditions of forced liquidation or distress.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p><b>Principal market:</b> It is assumed that the hypothetical transaction occurred in either the principal market for such a transaction, or in the absence of such a market, the most advantageous market. <i>Principal market</i> is defined as the market where the holder of the asset or liability could find the greatest volume of asset sales or liability transfers similar to the item in question. <i>Most advantageous market</i> is the one where the price received for the asset sale is maximized, or the transfer cost of the liability is minimized.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p><b>Market participants:</b> The market participants are the seller (holder of the asset or liability being valued) and the buyer in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. It is assumed that the seller and buyer are independent, knowledgeable, and have both the ability and willingness to complete the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ol></p><br/>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_1b_19.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>So what definition of value should be used in a business valuation engagement? The answer to that is quite simple &#8211; That depends! There are no one-size-fits all situations in the field of business valuation. Different value definitions should potentially be used for different business valuations&#8212;depending upon the circumstances related to the particular engagement. In fact, one of the items that must be clearly defined in a business valuation report is the standard of value that is used. The definition of value, purpose of the valuation, and type of ownership interest will affect the selection of valuation methods. For example, in a divorce engagement, a company will be valued based upon relevant statues and case law for the particular state where the divorce is being litigated&#8212;it is not unusual for the courts to require a particular definition of value for a particular case. Thus, the definition of value used is especially critical to the valuation process. The standard of value is:</p>

1 C. Reasons to Value Closely Held Businesses 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>The Valuation Process</h2>
<p>Valuation of a closely held business is the process by which a monetary value is established for an entire or partial interest in that business. The use of quantitative and qualitative factors determine the values of both tangible assets (such as receivables, inventory, and fixed assets) and intangible assets (such as patents and goodwill), which are then used to determine the worth of the company.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, SSVS No. 1 is a set of standards for CPAs to follow who are active in various business valuation engagements of both for profit and not-for-profit organizations. The existence of these standards does not preclude the necessity of the CPA to meet requirements set forth by any governmental or court regulations, or other professional standards such as the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. A critical item in the conduct code related to business valuation engagements is that the valuation analyst should not undertake any engagement for which the individual does not possess the requisite professional competence (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (2007), <i>Statement of Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i>, &#182; 11).</p>
<p>The analyst should possess:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An understanding of valuation principles and theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>The skill necessary to apply the theoretical knowledge of business valuation topics</p>
</li>
<li><p>The professional judgment necessary to develop a conclusion or calculation of value as defined in SSVS No. 1</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As in other areas of accounting practices, a CPA needs to continually refine the skills necessary to competently complete a particular engagement.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Objectivity and conflict of interest</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img2.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>The AICPA&#39;s <b>Code of Professional Conduct</b> requires CPAs to be objective when performing professional services. A CPA is expected to be impartial and free of conflicts of interest. SSVS No. 1 states that the CPA performing valuation services is expected to follow the AICPA's <b>Code of Professional Conduct</b> regarding objectivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>A member in public practice or his or her firm may be faced with a conflict of interest when performing a professional service. In determining whether a professional service, relationship or matter would result in a conflict of interest, a member should use professional judgment, taking into account whether a reasonable and informed third party who is aware of the relevant information would conclude that a conflict of interest exists.</p>
<p>A conflict of interest creates adverse interest and self-interest threats to the member&#39;s compliance with the Integrity and Objectivity rule. For example, threats may be created when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the member or the member&#39;s firm provides a professional service related to a particular matter involving two or more clients whose interests with respect to that matter are in conflict; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>the interests of the member or the member&#39;s firm with respect to a particular matter and the interests of the client for whom the member or the member&#39;s firm provides a professional service related to that matter are in conflict.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Independence</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img3.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Independence has been a sensitive topic in recent years, and it is not unusual for the CPA's independence related to attest activities to be questioned if they accept a business valuation engagement from a client.</p>
<p>(SSVS No. 1, &#182;15)</p>
<p>Threats to compliance with the &#8220;Independence Rule&#8221; [1.200.001] would not be at an acceptable level and could not be reduced to an acceptable level by the application of <i>safeguards</i> if the member performs an appraisal, a valuation, or an actuarial service for an attest client when:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(a)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>the services involve a significant degree of subjectivity, and</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(b)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>the results of the service, individually or when combined with other valuation, appraisal, or actuarial services, are material to the attest client's financial statements. Accordingly, independence would be impaired under these circumstances.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>Independence would be impaired if a member performs an appraisal, valuation, or actuarial service for an attest client where the results of the service, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to the financial statements and the appraisal, valuation, or actuarial service involves a significant degree of subjectivity.</p>
<p>(American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Code of Professional Conduct, ET Section 1.295.110.02 &#8211; Independence, Nonattest Services, Appraisal, Valuation and Actuarial Services)</p>
<p>Examples of valuations that generally involve a significant degree of subjectivity include, ESOPs, business combinations, or appraisals of assets or liabilities. Accordingly, if these services produce results that are material to the attest client's financial statements, independence would be impaired. Valuations performed in connection with, for example, employee stock ownership plans, business combinations, or appraisals of assets or liabilities generally involve a significant degree of subjectivity. Accordingly, if these services produce results that are material to the financial statements, independence would be impaired.</p>
<p>(American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (April 30, 2014), Code of Professional Conduct, ET Section 101 1.295.110.04 &#8211; Independence, .05 101-3 Nonattest Services, Appraisal, Valuation and Actuarial Services)</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>The purpose of the valuation</h3>
<p>The first step in a business valuation is to determine the purpose of the valuation. Different purposes for the valuation will often necessitate the use of different valuation methods that will result in different values.</p>
<p>Why does this occur? There are different state and federal statutes and regulations, and these different conventions affect the approach taken to valuations. For example, divorce law is guided by state statute, and the standards of value used by the states can vary. The most common choices are fair market value, intrinsic value, and investment value. Remember, fair market value assumes that there is a hypothetical (not specific) buyer and a hypothetical seller, both with reasonable knowledge of the business situation. Intrinsic value assumes that the parties involved have a greater understanding of the business situation than the typical investor. Investment value is based on the standard of value for a specific investor. Obviously, these three valuation approaches would likely lead to different determinations of value.</p>
<h3>Valuation date</h3>
<p>The valuation date can also lead to different business values. Again, looking at the divorce situation, the valuation date used in a divorce proceeding could be the date of the marriage, the date of the separation, the date of the filing, or the date of the trial. Since there can be years between the date of the marriage and the date of the trial, the determination of value can differ as a result of the valuation date chosen.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Identification of assets</h3>
<p>It is not unusual for an important marital asset to be a closely held business. As a general rule, at the dissolution of a marriage, a small, family run business is not divided between the spouses. One spouse will receive the business in the distribution of marital assets, and the other spouse will receive other assets of equal value. Obviously, a value for the business in question must be obtained and agreed upon by the two parties before the distribution of the assets can take place.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Caution</h2>
<p>Because divorce is covered by state laws, it is important for the individual preparing the business valuation to be aware of the definition of the standard of value in the state where the valuation is prepared. For example, goodwill and the inclusion of a covenant not to compete will be included in the definition of value for a closely held business in some states, not in others.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Estate planning</h3>
<p>The IRS will require a valuation of a nonpublicly traded business upon the death of the owner(s), for estate-tax purposes. As a practitioner, it is wise to suggest to clients who own such businesses that they obtain periodic valuations so that planning can be done to minimize the ultimate estate tax. The IRS is also more likely to accept the estate valuation when it has been done on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As part of estate planning, it is not unusual for business ownership to be passed on to the younger generations during the owner's lifetime. The IRS will require a proper valuation of such a gift. In the same light, charitable contributions of ownership in a closely held business need documentation to support the value of that donation.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Guidance</h2>
<p>Due to a large body of statutory law, IRS regulations, and long-standing case law, there is a great deal of direction provided to a business valuator when dealing with a business valuation that will be governed by federal tax laws (including employee stock ownership plans). The IRS leans towards the use of comparables (a market approach) and the use of fair market value as the standard of value. The business valuator can refer to Revenue Ruling 59-60 when preparing a tax-related business valuation for guidance as to what valuation approach to employ. As stated in Section 3.03 of Revenue Ruling 59-60:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>Valuation of securities is, in essence, a prophecy as to the future and must be based on facts available at the required date of appraisal. As a generalization, the prices of stocks which are traded in volume in a free and active market by informed persons best reflect the consensus of the investing public as to what the future holds for the corporations and industries represented. When a stock is closely held, is traded infrequently, or is traded in an erratic market, some other measure of value must be used. In many instances, the next best measure may be found in the prices at which the stocks of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business are selling in a free and open market.</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;3.03</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Tax-Related Valuations</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_1c_29.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>It is important to remember that tax-related valuations (estate and gift taxes) use the definition of fair market value that sets price at a level &#8220;at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell&#8221; (Revenue Ruling 59-60 , &#167;2.02). The valuations done for tax purposes also tend not to focus on future earnings since such returns are considered difficult to predict and speculative in nature. Thus, the focus is on the use of comparables.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Nontax Valuations</h2>
<h3>Sales of Businesses</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg19_290.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>There are also non-tax purposes for preparing a business valuation. The potential purchaser of a closely held business may wish to have a formal valuation prepared as a guide in determining the maximum offer that he will be willing to make. This potential purchaser will have a set of investment criteria that includes the investment value of the purchase. This is the value that an investor places on a business, taking into consideration projected income, projected cash flow, and risk.</p>
<p>The value of the investment is based upon the risk of holding the investment and the expected earnings due to potential synergies inherent in the investment. For example, the purchase of a distribution center could provide a great deal of synergy for a manufacturer of machine parts. Also, in a buy/sell situation, the seller could possess a higher level of knowledge about the closely held business than the typical investor, resulting in the use of intrinsic value as the valuation method.</p>
<p>On the other side, the seller may wish to have a formal valuation prepared as a guide in determining the minimum offer that she will be willing to accept. The seller may also approach the valuation process through the use of intrinsic and/or investment value as well as fair market value-what buyers are willing to pay. Business transactions occur within a larger framework guided by market conditions. For example, if there are numerous medical practices for sale in an area at a given time, it would be considered a &#8220;buyer's market&#8221; since, if a seller is motivated for personal reasons to sell quickly, that individual would be willing to accept a lower amount for the sale of a business. On the flip side, if a &#8220;seller's market&#8221; exists, buyers are often willing to pay the seller's intrinsic value.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Mergers</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cla_pg20_320.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>A business valuation may play an important part in determining stock exchange rates in the merger of a closely held company with a publicly traded organization. A merger is the combination of two separate companies through the exchange of stock and/or cash for stock or assets of the other. This type of business transaction would require valuation of both entities to determine a proper exchange rate for stock.</p>
<p>The majority shareholders of a closely held company may wish to buy out the minority shareholders, and a fair business valuation could be instrumental in determining the buyout price. All states have laws that provide recourse for minority stockholders if they feel that the compensation offered in a merger or buy-out is insufficient. Fair value generally is used in the business valuation required to resolve such a conflict.</p>
<p>Remember that <i>fair value</i> and <i>fair market value</i> are not one in the same. It is wise for the business valuator to be familiar with state statues and case law before attempting such a valuation assignment.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Lending</h3>
<p>Banks are often reluctant to lend funds to closely held businesses. A business valuation can determine the value of assets to be used as collateral. GAAP financial statements reflect the historical, depreciated cost of the business assets, which could be dramatically different than the fair market value of those assets. A valuation may also illustrate how the company can be expected to use those assets to generate future earnings and help convince the lender that enough cash will be generated to repay the potential loan.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Look at the following GAAP balance sheet for Dunbar Company:</p>
<div style="margin-top:14px;">
<table class="lt" width="650">
<tr>
    <td>Current Assets</td>
    <td align="right">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$&#160;&#160;&#160;75,000</td>

</div>
<p>The local bank is reluctant to lend money to Dunbar for expansion based upon the balance sheet. Using an asset-based approach where the assets are restated using fair market value, it was determined that the long-term assets were actually worth $180,000. This was due to the fact that the plant and equipment had a higher fair market value than the depreciated historical value as stated on the financial statements. Thus, using fair market value, the balance sheet could be restated as:</p>

<p>A banker may be less reluctant to provide an expansion loan for a company with a lower debt to equity ratio based upon the normalized financial statements.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>More reasons</h3>
<p>There are other reasons for valuing a closely held business:</p>
<h3>Initial public offerings</h3>
<p>A company's stock needs to be valued prior to an initial public offering. These companies often are small organizations that were developed around a particular product or service and are expected to experience rapid growth. Outside funding (through a public stock offering) is often necessary to support that growth.</p>
<h3>Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)</h3>
<p>An ESOP's stock has to be valued annually since the stock of the nonpublic company is used as additional compensation for employees. Since ESOPs come under federal regulation, the concept of fair market value is used when determining value.</p>
<h3>Damage determination</h3>
<p>Damage cases that relate to patent infringements, breaches of contract, wrongful death action, etc., often require a business valuation in order to determine the actual damages suffered. The definition of value can vary among different damage categories and jurisdictions. The business valuator should study the legal precedents that apply to the valuation in question.</p>
<h3>Spin-offs</h3>
<p>Sometimes a partial valuation is prepared if a segment of a closely held business is spun off.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Reminder</h2>
<p>The starting point in preparing a business valuation is to determine the purpose of that valuation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In valuing a going concern, future income may be a factor. In valuing a business that is liquidating, the value of the net assets would be the focus of the valuation due to the lack of potential future income flows. If the valuation is for estate or gift-tax purposes, the courts generally prefer verifiable facts to projections. Such facts would include the fair market value of the assets involved and past income.</p>
<p>An individual purchasing a closely held business would be interested in the value of the <i>intended</i> use of the assets, which might not necessarily be their <i>current</i> use.</p>

<p>If the buyer was purchasing this same business in order to obtain the land so that a parking ramp could be constructed after razing the current facility, he would be concerned about the future value that could be created by the proposed parking lot.

<h2>Choosing a Valuation Method</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg27_450.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Valuations need to be prepared using a method that will be compatible with the value being determined. When choosing a method, the valuation analyst needs to ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is liquidation going to occur? As future earnings would not be important in such a case, the liquidation value of the assets would be more appropriate to use than fair market value or replacement value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is this organization a going concern? In this case, earnings could play an important role in the valuation since it is assumed that the business will continue to operate well into the future. How the company will use its operating assets becomes an important issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the opportunity costs for the use of this business? Are there alternative uses for the facility? What is the best use of the business assets?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the legal requirements for this valuation? Especially in estate- and gift-tax situations, the IRS regulations involving valuation are important. Remember, the IRS and courts tend to favor a valuation based on historical facts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg28_470.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>The choice of the appropriate valuation method will be based on the circumstances of the particular case. There are a number of different approaches available to the valuator, and the four most common are as follows:</p>

<img src="common/bullets/decimal_1_on.gif" alt="decimal_1 image"/>
<p>Market approach</p>
<br/>

</li>
<li><p>Income approach</p>
</li>
<li><p>Excess-income approach</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Market approach</h3>
<p>A market approach seeks market comparisons in order to determine the value of a closely held business. This valuation method is preferred by the IRS and courts, so a search for comparables should be performed. However, it can be difficult&#8212;and often impossible&#8212;to find useful guideline companies or comparables.</p>
<p>The use of guideline companies when valuing a closely held business will be discussed in more detail later in the course. Please note that &#8220;comparable&#8221; and &#8220;guideline&#8221; are considered to be similar terms; however, the term &#8220;guideline&#8221; has become the preferred name in recent years.</p>

<h3>Asset-based approach</h3>
<p>The most common asset-based approach is the <i>adjusted net assets method,</i> also known as both the <i>net asset value method</i> and the <i>adjusted book value method.</i> The basis of this method is to calculate the value of the business by deducting the fair market value of the company's liabilities from the fair market value of the assets. In other words, the equity of the firm is based upon the fair market value&#8212;as opposed to the book value&#8212;of the assets and liabilities</p>
<p>An asset-based approach is an excellent example of what is known as the &#8220;economic substitution principle.&#8221; It states that no one would be willing to pay more for an asset than the price to obtain a substitute.</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/example.gif" alt="Example image"/>
<br/>
<p>Assume that you wish to purchase laminating equipment to start a business out of your home, and you are convinced that you can sell everything that you produce. All else being equal, you will not be willing to pay supplier A more for the inputs than supplier B is willing to accept for the same materials.</p>
<p>Similarly, you will not be willing to pay more than the fair market value for a business provided that another business is available at a similar price, and that the second business has similar assets and equal risk and is a reasonable substitute for the first.</p>

<p>When using the adjusted net assets method for valuing land and a factory building, the land is valued separately from the improvements. The land should be valued at its highest and best use.</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/example.gif" alt="Example image"/>
<br/>
<p>If you were to value a small restaurant located on two lots in the middle of a crowded office district, the highest and best use of the land may be for a parking ramp. It is for this use that the land valuation will be based.</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>When valuing the improvements, the valuation needs to take into consideration allowances for functional obsolescence, physical deterioration, and economic or external obsolescence. The total value for the real estate being valued would be the sum of the fair market value of the land and the improvements. The use of a professional real estate appraiser probably will be necessary to help in the determination of the fair market value. In fact, business valuations often require a team approach since the individual preparing the valuation often is not an expert in establishing land, building, and/or equipment values. SSVS No. 1 provides guidelines for the CPA when enlisting the services of other professionals such as real estate appraisers or equipment appraisers in the course of a business valuation.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>Per SSVS No. 1:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>In performing an engagement to estimate value, the valuation analyst may rely on the work of a third party specialist (for example, a real estate or equipment appraiser). The valuation analyst should note in the assumptions and limiting conditions the level of responsibility, if any, being assumed by the valuation analyst for the work of the third party specialist. At the option of the valuation analyst, the written report of the third-party specialist may be included in the valuation analyst's report.</p>

<p>The adjusted net assets method provides a floor value for valuing a company, since an owner will seldom accept less than the net asset value for a business. An acceptable value could be lower than the fair market value for the entire company, such as replacement value for an insurance claim, but never less than the liquidation value. The owner could liquidate the firm's assets instead of selling the entire business if liquidation would be more profitable. Again, the substitution principle comes into play. Although most sellers hope to receive more than the adjusted net assets value due to the existence of goodwill, the adjusted net assets method can provide a reality check for other valuation methods. <b><i>No business valuation should establish a value below liquidation value for the assets involved.</i></b></p>

<h3>When is it Appropriate to use an Asset-Based Approach?</h3>
<p>The asset-based approach is an excellent method to use for:</p>

<img src="common/custom-images/pen01_on.gif" alt="pen01 image"/>
<p>a company that does not generate income,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/pen01_on.gif" alt="pen01 image"/>
<p>ones that have generally had losses,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/pen01_on.gif" alt="pen01 image"/>
<p>organizations in bankruptcy,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/pen01_on.gif" alt="pen01 image"/>
<p>non-profit organizations,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/pen01_on.gif" alt="pen01 image"/>
<p>asset-intensive firms, and</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/pen01_on.gif" alt="pen01 image"/>
<p>holding companies.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>A general rule is that the subject company represents its &#8220;value&#8221; in tangible assets&#8212;or intangible assets such as patents or copyrights&#8212;that can easily be assigned a market, replacement, or liquidation value. It is also important that the individual(s) holding the controlling interest has the ability to liquidate the assets of the organization. This means that if the valuation is being done for a minority interest, an asset-based approach would not be suitable since the minority shareholder would not have the ability to force a sale of the company's assets. An asset-based approach would not be suitable to use for a service company, or one that has few assets.</p>
<p>Revenue Ruling 59-60 states that the asset-based valuation approach may best be applied when the company in question has significant nonoperating assets in the form of investments, such as real estate. Revenue Ruling 59-60 further states the following:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>In general, the appraiser will accord primary consideration to earnings when valuing stocks of companies which sell products or services to the public; conversely, in the investment or holding type company, the appraiser may accord the greatest weight to the assets underlying the security to be valued.</p>

<h3>Income approach</h3>
<p>Many investors are not satisfied with only a two- or three-percent return on invested funds. These investors may wish to purchase stock in a publicly traded organization. Because an investment in stock is riskier than a certificate of deposit, investors will require a higher rate of return to compensate for the risk of the stock investment.</p>
<p>The income-oriented approaches to business valuation are based on the theory that an investor will require an investment to yield a return sufficient to recover the initial cost of the investment, as well as provide a return sufficient to compensate for the perceived risk of that investment. In other words, the higher the perceived risk, the higher the expected return required to attract potential investors. This return comes in the form of future earnings. It is reasonable to assume that the actual or expected earnings and/or cash flows of a closely held business are critical components when determining a value for such an organization</p>
<p>Because future net cash inflows are used to determine a value for the subject organization when using an income-oriented approach to business valuation, it is important that the company be a going concern that is expected to have a positive future income-producing capacity. This method incorporates the theory of discounted cash flows.</p>
<p>Future net cash inflows are projected, and then those net cash inflows are discounted to a present value using an appropriate discount rate reflecting the degree of risk involved in the investment proposal. These income based approaches require a thorough analysis of revenues, costs, capital assets, capital structure, the industry, the national and/or international economy, and the region in which the company operates in order to develop a realistic forecast of future net cash inflows. The analyst is also required to choose appropriate capitalization and/or discount rates to reflect the risk of the investment.</p>

<h3>Excess-income approach</h3>
<p><i>The excess earnings (Treasury) method</i> is one of the most common approaches used in the valuation of closely held businesses. It is also an approach that is frequently misapplied. This method is actually a combination of an asset-based approach and an income approach. The excess earnings method separates the income stream into two distinct parts:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The normal income created by the net tangible assets of the company</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>The excess income created by the intangible assets of the company</p>
</li>
</ol></p><br/>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_1d_51.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>The value of the company is then determined by adding the adjusted book value of the net tangible assets to the capitalized value of the excess earnings. It could be said that this approach arrives at a value for a business by combining the value of the net tangible assets and the intangible assets,</p>
<p>The excess earnings method acquired its name from the IRS in <i>Appeals and Review Memorandum Number 34</i> (ARM 34) and Revenue Ruling 68-609. This method combines the income and asset-based approaches since both the fair market value of the assets and excess earnings are used in preparing a valuation for a closely held business.</p>
<p>The theoretical premise for this method is that the total value of a firm is the sum of the values of the adjusted net assets as determined using the adjusted net assets method, and the value of the intangible assets. The value of the intangible assets is determined by capitalizing the business earnings that exceed a reasonable rate of return for the adjusted net assets of the business. A reasonable rate of return is often defined as the rate that is average for the industry.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>This method first appeared in ARM 34, which was published in 1920 by the U.S. Treasury Department (thus the name &#8220;Treasury Method&#8221;). This method was devised to estimate the intangible value of goodwill that breweries and distilleries lost because of Prohibition. This method has been widely used to estimate the value of businesses for gift tax, estate tax, and other taxation purposes. It is often used for valuing businesses and professional practices in divorce cases.</p>
<p>The valuation method set out by the IRS in ARM 34 uses a formula approach. The theory behind this method is that the company's net tangible assets could be expected to earn a &#8220;normal profit&#8221; that was defined as an 8- to 10-percent return on those assets. Any profit above that normal return would be due to the fact that the business had intangible assets (goodwill).</p>
<p>The IRS suggested that those intangible assets could result in a 15- to 20-percent return. Although ARM 34 was originally developed for use with breweries and distilleries, this method has been used for companies in many types of industries. Over time, however, it has been determined that the rates as indicated in this memorandum are not appropriate for <i>all</i> companies, in <i>all</i> industries, in <i>all</i> situations. In fact, the IRS has become disenchanted with its own valuation method, and Revenue Ruling 68-609 was issued in an attempt to curb misinterpretations of the Treasury method.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>The [excess earning] approach may be used for determining the fair market value of intangible assets of a business only if there is no better basis therefore available.</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 68-609, 1968-2 C.B. 327 IRC Sec. 1001</p>

<p>This valuation method was restated in 1968 in Revenue Ruling 68-609, which is still in effect today. This method was originally created for the purpose of valuing intangible assets, but it has often been used to value a company as a whole. Prior to ARM 34, businesses were generally sold at the value of the tangible assets, since intangible assets were not deemed to have value. Two key perceptions emerged from ARM 34.</p>

<img src="common/custom-images/pointinghand_g_on.gif" alt="pointinghand_g image"/>
<p>Excess earnings were due to the company's goodwill.</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/pointinghand_g_on.gif" alt="pointinghand_g image"/>
<p>The value of the goodwill could be calculated by capitalizing the excess earnings.</p>
<br/>
<p>ARM 34 states that <i>excess earnings</i> are the company's earnings that are in excess of the earnings above the average for companies in the industry with similar size and activities. Obviously, a study of companies in the industry is necessary when using this method</p>
