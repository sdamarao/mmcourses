<h2>The Valuation Process</h2>
<p>Valuation of a closely held business is the process by which a monetary value is established for an entire or partial interest in that business. The use of quantitative and qualitative factors determine the values of both tangible assets (such as receivables, inventory, and fixed assets) and intangible assets (such as patents and goodwill), which are then used to determine the worth of the company.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, SSVS No. 1 is a set of standards for CPAs to follow who are active in various business valuation engagements of both for profit and not-for-profit organizations. The existence of these standards does not preclude the necessity of the CPA to meet requirements set forth by any governmental or court regulations, or other professional standards such as the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. A critical item in the conduct code related to business valuation engagements is that the valuation analyst should not undertake any engagement for which the individual does not possess the requisite professional competence (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (2007), <i>Statement of Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i>, &#182; 11).</p>
<p>The analyst should possess:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An understanding of valuation principles and theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>The skill necessary to apply the theoretical knowledge of business valuation topics</p>
</li>
<li><p>The professional judgment necessary to develop a conclusion or calculation of value as defined in SSVS No. 1</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As in other areas of accounting practices, a CPA needs to continually refine the skills necessary to competently complete a particular engagement.</p>
