<p>Asset size is one of the variables most likely to eliminate many potential firms as possible guideline companies. Without considering anything else, size does not cause a problem, but it often serves as a proxy for other issues which set firms in the same line of business apart from each other.</p>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>example</b></span></p>
<p>The firms in our previous example have similar <a title="Glossary Term:Debt-to-Equity Ratio" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/d641.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">debt-to-equity ratios</a>, but the question often relates to type and availability of credit. Many large publicly traded firms have access to the bond market to raise funds, while some privately held companies might qualify for nothing more than a bank loan, which is limited by the personal guarantee of the owner. The issue here would relate to the ease of access to additional credit.</p>
</div>
<p>Many closely held businesses do not have&#8212;and cannot afford&#8212;the depth of management available to larger organizations. The owner of the small firm often wears many hats (e.g., CEO, engineer, accountant, human resource manager, marketing manager, etc.) compared to the larger firm, which has qualified individuals in each functional area. There is also greater risk in terms of succession in smaller firms. If the CEO of a larger organization dies or becomes incapacitated, there generally are qualified replacements available. If the owner/manager of the small firm dies, however, the company might be forced to liquidate, because there is often no one available to fill this individual's roles. The inheriting family members might not have the skills or desire necessary to keep the firm operating.</p>
<p>Closely held firms often produce only one&#8212;or no more than a few&#8212;products. As firms grow, they often diversify into different product lines in order to reduce the risk of having &#8220;all one's eggs in the same basket.&#8221; It is questionable if a single-product firm can be compared to a multifaceted company, even if they are in the same NAICS category.</p>
