<p>Unlike the situation in <i>Berg</i>, CPAs now have guidelines to use when performing a business valuation from the time of the acceptance of the engagement, the gathering of data, the development of a value, and finally, the writing of the report. By following the standards set in this statement, the valuation analyst will gain credibility in the legal setting and the business community at large. The <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i> (SSVS No. 1) is effective for all business valuations accepted on or after January 1, 2008, that are prepared by members of the AICPA. The statement can be downloaded as a PDF file from the AICPA's website. Any CPA involved with valuation engagements needs to be familiar with the contents of SSVS No. 1 and follow the steps outlined in the statement.</p>
<p>In addition, both the AICPA and NACVA (National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts) have developed rigorous certification programs with continuing education requirements for CPAs preparing business valuations. These programs include written, proctored examinations, and involvement with business valuations under the tutelage of a qualified individual before certification is granted. These programs have allowed certified individuals to support their claims that they are &#8220;experts&#8221; in business valuation.</p>
