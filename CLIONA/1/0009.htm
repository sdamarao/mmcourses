<p>In 1991, there was a landmark court case regarding business valuation&#8212;<i>Estate of Edgar A Berg v. Commissioner (T.C. Memo 1991-279)</i>. The two CPAs who provided the valuation for the Berg Estate were in academia. They did not have formal education in the area of business valuation, were not members of a business valuation or appraisal organization, and only made passing reference to a prior court case as support for their business valuation result. On the other hand, the IRS expert did have training in business valuation and used recognized studies of comparables to support the assets being valued. Until this time, the courts would often use the average of the business valuations presented by each side. However, in the <i>Berg</i> case, the court chose the IRS's position, since the report provided by its expert was comprehensive, logical, supported, and well presented. This case marked a change in how business valuations were approached, and it highlighted the importance of the background and education of the valuation analyst.</p>
