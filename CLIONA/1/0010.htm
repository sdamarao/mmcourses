<h2>New standards for business valuation</h2>
<p>In 2001, the AICPA began to develop a set of standards that defined the business valuation process and reporting. Over a period of six years, individuals from various AICPA committees&#8212;along with other experts in the business valuation and accounting fields&#8212;participated in the development of an Exposure Draft. The draft was issued in 2005 and then revised based upon comments received from professionals actively working in the business valuation area. A second draft was published in 2006.</p>
<p>On June 21, 2007, the AICPA issued the <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1, Valuation of a Business, Business Ownership Interest, Security, or Intangible Asset</i>. Per the AICPA's news release:</p>
<div class="Q">
<a style="text-decoration:underline;Color: #0078AE " title="" role="button" id="wrap2" href="#" onClick="if(document.getElementById('divwrap2DescText').style.display=='none'){document.getElementById('divwrap2DescText').style.display=''}else{document.getElementById('divwrap2DescText').style.display='none'}"><img src="common/images/quote.gif"  border=0 ></a>
<div id="divwrap2DescText" style="display:none;"><p>The AICPA developed the valuation standard to improve the consistency and quality of practice among its members who perform engagements that estimate values for various reasons .&#160;.&#160;. Congress, government agencies, and accounting regulators have recently focused their attention on appraisal issues&#8212;such activity shows the importance of valuation to the business community and individuals. In addition, an increasing number of CPAs offer valuation services. The standard promotes greater transparency and provides our members with a set of guidelines in the unique context of a CPA practice.</p>
