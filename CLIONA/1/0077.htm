<h3>The Determination of the Existence of Goodwill or Other Intangible Assets</h3>

<p>Goodwill is the value above the fair value of the net assets that a buyer is willing to pay for the purchase of a company. It is thought to be created by the reputation of the organization and advantages that it has over the competition. The more profitable a company is in relation to what is considered to be a fair return on the operating assets, the greater the goodwill. The valuator must consider whether the reputation might be subject to a key man discount.</p>
<p>If business value could be calculated by using nothing more than the net liquidation value of the assets, business valuation would be easy and done by appraisers. However, it is the existence of intangible assets that makes business valuation more of an art than a science. Just what value does a trade name or brand name recognition have?</p>
