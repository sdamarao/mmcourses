<h3>Elements of Fair Market Value</h3>
<p>Looking closely at the definition of fair market value, the important elements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There must be two unrelated parties involved&#8212;a hypothetical willing buyer and a hypothetical willing seller. Neither party is under any compulsion to buy or sell. Both are free to walk away from any negotiated deal that is not satisfactory to them. Note that the seller and buyer are &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; and not specific, and the characteristics of this hypothetical buyer or seller are not necessarily the same as the characteristics of an actual buyer or seller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both parties must have reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. Both parties are aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the business in question. They are also knowledgeable about the industry and the economy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These facts are used to predict a future which is neither unreasonably pessimistic nor unreasonably optimistic. Fair market value is agreeable to both sides, given that both parties want to make the best deal possible. In other words, the fair market value is the most probable selling price, as opposed to the highest or lowest negotiated price.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is the price upon which the intelligent and reasonable buyer and seller would agree. Neither party has an advantage over the other in knowledge, understanding of the issues, or legal or technical resources. In other words, a level playing field exists.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is determined for a specific valuation date, and the hypothetical seller and buyer do not have knowledge about unforeseeable future events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is considered to be the highest and best use of the <a title="Glossary Term:Property" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/d362.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">property</a> and not necessarily the value related to how the property is currently used. For example, land currently may be used for farming. The best use of the property, however, may be for a large retail establishment. In such a case, the land should be valued for use as a retail establishment.</p>
</li>
