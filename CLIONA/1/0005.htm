<p>Today, investors have a wide variety of investment alternatives, including financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds), commodities, real estate, and collectibles (such as artwork and rare coins). The investor's purchasing and selling decisions for these investments generally are based on the expectation of the possible returns that could be received&#8212;sometime in the future&#8212;for funds invested today. These possible returns are relative to the perceived riskiness of the investment. Hundreds of millions of shares of stock&#8212;and billions of dollars in bonds of publicly held corporations&#8212;are traded daily, providing nearly instantaneous information as to the market value of these assets.</p>
<p>This works well with publicly traded companies, but how does an investor determine the market value of an ownership interest in a closely held business whose stock is not exchanged on public markets?</p>
