<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Size is often a major difference between a closely held organization and a publicly traded company. Wal-Mart&#174; cannot be compared to a small family owned retail establishment serving a little neighborhood. An extremely large company cannot be considered to be comparable to a small, closely held one. What makes a possible guideline too large? One of the rules of thumb that is often used by valuators is to select a possible group of guideline companies that have sales no larger than 10 to 25 times the sales volume of the company being valued.</p>
<p>The important point here is that whatever the acceptable size difference, it is essential the companies also have similar products or markets as well as similar asset structures. For example, a guideline cannot use financing sources not available to the subject company, such as the sale of bonds.</p>
<h3>Financial Reporting and Normalization</h3>
<p>The valuator also needs to be aware of differences in how financial results are reported, or of the existence of unusual events. For example, if the subject company uses a FIFO inventory method and the possible guideline uses a LIFO inventory method, then an adjustment needs to be made so that the financials being compared use the same inventory valuation method. Another area where normalization adjustments might be required would include dealing with different depreciation methods, e.g., the firm being valued depreciates its fixed assets using the straight-line method while the guideline companies use an alternative approach such as an accelerated method. Also, if a company has a significant amount of operating leases there will be an artificially low enterprise value as the lease-based debt is ignored and also would have a correspondingly low EBITA since rental expenses would include interest costs. This can be adjusted for by adding the value of the lease to the market value of the debt and an implied interest expense to EBITA.</p>
<p>The information for such an adjustment is generally found in the notes to the financial statements. Another frequently needed adjustment would be one for an extraordinary event. Such an adjustment would be made to improve the comparability of the organizations. Often the closely held company's financial statements will need to be normalized.</p>
