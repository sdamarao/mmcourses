<p>The next step in the search for a guideline company is to look for similar trends in operating performance. If the sales of the closely held organization had shown a healthy increase over the last few years, and the sales of a possible guideline showed a steep decline, then it is unlikely that the two organizations are operating in markets that react to various economic factors in a similar fashion. Also, even if both firms have been growing, the growth for one may have been due to acquisitions while the growth for the company being valued might have come from increased sales at existing locations; therefore, in both cases described, the potential guideline company would not provide a good comparison.</p>
<p>As noted above, size is often the major difference between a closely held organization and a publicly traded company. To deal with this problem, the valuator may wish to search for similar companies for which deals have recently been completed (purchases or mergers) that are not publicly traded companies. This is what is referred to as the Guideline Transaction Method. This may allow the valuator to overcome the size issue, but care must be taken to ensure that the level of detailed transaction information is available for the firm so that sufficient operating results can be determined.</p>
