<p>A business valuation may play an important part in determining stock exchange rates in the <a title="Glossary Term:Merger" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/d1001.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">merger</a> of a closely held company with a publicly traded organization. A merger is the combination of two separate companies through the exchange of stock and/or cash for stock or assets of the other. This type of business transaction would require valuation of both entities to determine a proper exchange rate for stock.</p>
<p>The majority shareholders of a closely held company may wish to buy out the minority shareholders, and a fair business valuation could be instrumental in determining the buyout price. All states have laws that provide recourse for minority stockholders if they feel that the compensation offered in a merger or buy-out is insufficient. Fair value generally is used in the business valuation required to resolve such a conflict.</p>
<p>Remember that <i>fair value</i> and <i>fair market value</i> are not one in the same. It is wise for the business valuator to be familiar with state statues and case law before attempting such a valuation assignment.</p>
