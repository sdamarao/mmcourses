<p>A closely held firm is frequently a small competitor and generally a follower rather than a leader in the industry. The subject firm most likely serves only the wholesale or retail segments of the business, while potential guidelines might serve both market segments. A potential guideline company might concentrate its activities in the <a title="Glossary Term:Business Segment" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/d987.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">segment</a> not served by the firm being valued. In addition, a small firm that serves customers in a single geographic region of the United States might not be comparable to a firm that has a broad international customer base.</p>
<p>Publicly traded companies often pay dividends; however, most closely held organizations do not. The closely held corporation frequently increases the owner/manager's salary and benefits in lieu of dividends in order to avoid the double taxation of dividends. This compensation issue introduces an additional question concerning the possible need to normalize the financial statements of a closely held firm before they can be used in the valuation process. The normalization process is outside the scope of this course.</p>
