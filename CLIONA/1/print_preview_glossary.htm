<h1>Business Segment</h1>
<p>The following terms and descriptions of business segments are taken from FASB ASC 280-10-50 (Segment Reporting).</p>
<p><b>Operating segment.</b> This is a component of an enterprise:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>that engages in business activities where it earns revenues and incurs expenses,</p>
</li>
<li><p>whose operating results are regularly reviewed by chief operating decision makers, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>for which discrete financial information is available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain operating segments may also be <i>reportable segments</i> (&#182;10).</p>
<p><b>Reportable segment.</b> Operating segments that meet one of the following quantitative tests are reportable segments (&#182;18):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Segment revenue (both to external customers and intersegmental) is at least 10% of total revenue of all operating segments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The absolute amount of segment profit (or loss) is at least 10% of all operating segments with a profit (or loss).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Operating segment assets are at least 10% of total assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reportable segments must report their revenue, profit (or loss), assets, and other related items (&#182;27).</p>
<p>Enterprises must report the extent of reliance on major customers&#8212;those who comprise at least 10% of sales (&#182;39).</p>

<h1>Business Valuation</h1>
<p>The act or process of determining the value of a business enterprise or ownership interest therein. <b>(International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms)</b></p>

<h1>Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h1>
<p>The debt-to-equity ratio is a leverage ratio that measures the extent of financial leverage used by the firm and the creditor protection in the event of insolvency. It measures the balance between financing provided by creditors and by owners. Debt-to-equity is a transformation of debt and equity ratios. It increases exponentially as the firm uses a greater proportion of debt, approaching infinity.</p>
<p>The computation is total liabilities (debt) &#247; total owners' equity.</p>
<p>Limitations on use of this ratio include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The denominator reflects historical values, not current values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The items that are included in the totals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>preferred stock, which is usually considered <i>debt</i> for the purpose of this ratio;</p>
</li>
<li><p>equity, which is common stock;</p>
</li>
<li><p>contributed capital in excess of common;</p>
</li>
<li><p>capital leases, which are considered debt; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>retained earnings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Averages should be used in both the numerator and denominator.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Fair Market Value (FMV)</h1>
<p>The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
<hr id="djb102"/>
<h1>Going Concern</h1>
<p>A going concern is a business entity that is expected to continue in operation indefinitely. An enterprise that is no longer considered a going concern is assumed to be approaching, or in the process of, dissolution.</p>
<hr id="d1001"/>
<h1>Merger</h1>
<p>A merger is when one company (A) acquires another (B) with the latter (B) ceasing to exist: A + B = A. It is a fusion. It is when two or more companies physically combine operations with all but one ceasing to exist as a legally recognized entity. A merger must be accounted for as a purchase. Pooling of interests for new mergers is no longer allowed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Personalty (personal property)&#8212;everything that is the subject of ownership that is not real property (movables)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Revenue Ruling 59-60</h1>
