<p>During the process of finding guideline transactions that seem to be well-suited to the subject of the valuation, it is also necessary to look at factors such as the reason for the potential guideline transaction being considered. Often, the name of the buyer will provide information. For example, if the purchase is for synergistic purposes, the price paid by the buyer might be inflated due to the specific gains that would accrue specifically to that buyer and not be available to a generic purchaser. Also, the purchase might be related to a forced liquidation in bankruptcy, which could tend to significantly reduce the sale price of the firm.</p>
<p>Once some number of companies found in the transactions databases have been established to meet the standards to be included as a guideline, the next step is to determine the appropriate multiple(s) and calculate the value as described in the example shown above using the Guideline Public Method. One good way to select the appropriate multiple(s) is to choose the multiple or multiples that are most tightly clustered in the industry of which the subject company is a part. This type of multiple would tend to be the most appropriate one to use in a value estimate. A wide dispersion of multiples often indicates a Valuation Ratio might not be meaningful for a particular industry. A Valuation Ratio is defined as a &#8220;fraction in which a value or price serves as numerator and financial, operating, or physical data serves as denominator.&#8221; (<i>International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms</i>, June 2001) The calculation value using multiples is demonstrated below.</p>
<p>Assume the median measures for guideline companies chosen from a transaction database are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MVIC/Sales &#8211; 0.697 (MVIC = market value of invested capital);</p>
</li>
<li><p>MVIC/EBITDA &#8211; 5.817 (EBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization); and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Equity Price/Earnings &#8211; 13.00.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is information about the subject company:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normalized sales &#8211; $34,389,893;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Long-term Debt &#8211; $5,756,374;</p>
</li>
<li><p>EBITDA &#8211; $4,160,881; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Earnings &#8211; $1,657,350.</p>
</li>
</ul>
