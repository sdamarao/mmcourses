<h2>Choosing a Valuation Method</h2>

<p>Valuations need to be prepared using a method that will be compatible with the value being determined. When choosing a method, the valuation analyst needs to ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is liquidation going to occur? As future earnings would not be important in such a case, the liquidation value of the assets would be more appropriate to use than fair market value or replacement value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is this organization a going concern? In this case, earnings could play an important role in the valuation since it is assumed that the business will continue to operate well into the future. How the company will use its operating assets becomes an important issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the opportunity costs for the use of this business? Are there alternative uses for the facility? What is the best use of the business assets?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the legal requirements for this valuation? Especially in estate- and gift-tax situations, the IRS regulations involving valuation are important. Remember, the IRS and courts tend to favor a valuation based on historical facts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
