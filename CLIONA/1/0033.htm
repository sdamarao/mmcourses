<h2>Guidance</h2>
<p>Due to a large body of statutory law, IRS regulations, and long-standing case law, there is a great deal of direction provided to a business valuator when dealing with a business valuation that will be governed by federal tax laws (including employee stock ownership plans). The IRS leans towards the use of comparables (a market approach) and the use of fair market value as the standard of value. The business valuator can refer to Revenue Ruling 59-60 when preparing a tax-related business valuation for guidance as to what valuation approach to employ. As stated in Section 3.03 of Revenue Ruling 59-60:</p>

<div id="divwrap4DescText" style="display:none;"><p>Valuation of securities is, in essence, a prophecy as to the future and must be based on facts available at the required date of appraisal. As a generalization, the prices of stocks which are traded in volume in a free and active market by informed persons best reflect the consensus of the investing public as to what the future holds for the corporations and industries represented. When a stock is closely held, is traded infrequently, or is traded in an erratic market, some other measure of value must be used. In many instances, the next best measure may be found in the prices at which the stocks of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business are selling in a free and open market.</p>
