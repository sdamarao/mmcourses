<p>The value of the company is then determined by adding the adjusted book value of the net tangible assets to the capitalized value of the excess earnings. It could be said that this approach arrives at a value for a business by combining the value of the net tangible assets and the intangible assets,</p>
<p>The excess earnings method acquired its name from the IRS in <i>Appeals and Review Memorandum Number 34</i> (ARM 34) and Revenue Ruling 68-609. This method combines the income and asset-based approaches since both the fair market value of the assets and excess earnings are used in preparing a valuation for a closely held business.</p>
<p>The theoretical premise for this method is that the total value of a firm is the sum of the values of the adjusted net assets as determined using the adjusted net assets method, and the value of the intangible assets. The value of the intangible assets is determined by capitalizing the business earnings that exceed a reasonable rate of return for the adjusted net assets of the business. A reasonable rate of return is often defined as the rate that is average for the industry.</p>
