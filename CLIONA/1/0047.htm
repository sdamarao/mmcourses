<h3>Asset-based approach</h3>
<p>The most common asset-based approach is the <i>adjusted net assets method,</i> also known as both the <i>net asset value method</i> and the <i>adjusted book value method.</i> The basis of this method is to calculate the value of the business by deducting the fair market value of the company's liabilities from the fair market value of the assets. In other words, the equity of the firm is based upon the fair market value&#8212;as opposed to the book value&#8212;of the assets and liabilities</p>
<p>An asset-based approach is an excellent example of what is known as the &#8220;economic substitution principle.&#8221; It states that no one would be willing to pay more for an asset than the price to obtain a substitute.</p>

<p>Similarly, you will not be willing to pay more than the fair market value for a business provided that another business is available at a similar price, and that the second business has similar assets and equal risk and is a reasonable substitute for the first.</p>
