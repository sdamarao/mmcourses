</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg2_740.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Recall the previous discussion of the provisions of Revenue Ruling 59-60 and Regulation Sections 20.2031-1(b) and 25.2512-1, which provided, respectively, a definition of a closely held business and of the concept of fair market value for the purposes of valuing a closely held business. These sources suggested that when dealing with the valuation of a closely held firm for estate- and gift-tax purposes, the IRS and the courts prefer that the valuation be based on historical facts rather than projections. In this context, it is desirable that the valuation be based on the use of guideline companies (formerly known as comparables).</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will deal with the key issues associated with finding and using guideline companies in the valuation process as well as discuss the basic analytical issues involved in a business valuation when using a market method.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>What is a Guideline Company?</h3>
<p>A comparable company has been defined as one which has <i>reasonable</i> and <i>justifiable</i> similarity to the closely held business that is being valued. The issue of reasonable similarity has been addressed in two cases. <i>Tallichet v. Commissioner,</i> T.C. Memo 1974-255 (1974), indicated that there are &#8220;guideposts in determining comparability.&#8221; <i>Estate of Victor B. Clarke, T.C. Memo 1976-328 (1976),</i> stated &#8220;it is imperative that the characteristics of the subject company and the purported comparable company relevant to the question of value be isolated and examined so that significant comparison can be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>These cases take into account factors such as:</p>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>the products provided,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>markets served,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>size of the firm,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>earnings,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>capital structure,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>dividend-paying capacity,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>management capability, and</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/bullets/key_on.gif" alt="key image"/>
<p>financing sources.</p>
<br/>
<p>Justifiable similarity means that the valuator could defend his/her choice of guidelines to other informed individuals.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>In Revenue Ruling 59-60, it is stated:</p>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg3_745.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>.&#160;.&#160;.that in valuing unlisted securities the value of stock or securities of corporations engaged in the same or a similar line of business which are listed on an exchange should be taken into consideration along with all other factors.&#160;.&#160;. Although the only restrictive requirement as to comparable corporations specified in the statute is that their lines of business be the same or similar, yet it is obvious that consideration must be given to other relevant factors in order that the most valid comparison possible will be obtained.</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.02(h)</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>Thus, while the statute requires that firms simply be in a similar line of business to be considered a guideline company, the IRS indicates that this &#8220;similarity&#8221; must extend to other factors as well.</p>
<p>There are two basic approaches for using guideline companies.</p>
<p>The <b>guideline public company method</b> which is:</p>
<p class="blockpara">A method within the market approach whereby market multiples are derived from the prices of stock of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that are actually traded on the free and open market (<b>International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms, June 2001)</b></p><p>The <b>guideline company transaction method</b> which is:</p>
<p class="blockpara">The market approach whereby market multiples are derived from transactions of significant interest in companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business (<b>International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms, June 2001)</b></p></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Other Relevant Factors in the Analysis of Closely Held Companies</h3>
<p>It is important to understand what these vital relevant factors are when approaching a business valuation. Section 4.01 of Revenue Ruling 59-60 states:</p>
<p>It is advisable to emphasize that in the valuation of the stock of closely held corporations or the stock of corporations where market quotations are either lacking or too scarce to be recognized, all available financial data, as well as all relevant factors affecting the fair market value, should be considered. The following factors, although not all-inclusive, are fundamental and require careful analysis in each case:</p>

<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
<li value="1"><p>The nature of the business and the history of the enterprise from its inception</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>The economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook of the specific industry in particular</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>The book value of the stock and the financial condition of the business</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>The earning capacity of the company</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>The dividend-paying capacity</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Whether or not the enterprise has goodwill or other intangible value</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Sales of the stock and the size of the block of stock to be valued</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>The market price of stocks of corporations engaged in the same or a similar line of business having their stocks actively traded in a free and open market, either on an exchange or over-the-counter</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.01</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Nature of the Business</h3>
<p>It is important to understand the historic performance of the subject company. Has the company shown stable or unstable performance in the past? Has the asset base or the reported profit increased or decreased in the years that comprise the data set? Does the organization provide a diverse set of products or services, or does it lack diversity? As stated in Revenue Ruling 59-60:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>The history to be studied should include, but need not be limited to, the nature of the business, its products or services, its operating and investment assets, capital structure, plant facilities, sales records and management, all of which should be considered as of the date of the appraisal, with due regard for recent significant changes. Events of the past that are unlikely to recur in the future should be discounted, since value has a close relation to future expectancy. Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.02(a)</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>This historical review of the subject organization will aid the valuator in gaining a thorough understanding of the subject company.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Economic Outlook</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_2a_8.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>The regional, national, and international economic outlook in respect to the subject company must be considered. Since the significance of specific economic factors can vary greatly from one industry to another, it is important to have a firm understanding of how various economic indicators may affect the growth prospects of the industry as well as of the subject company. For example, a decrease in housing starts would likely decrease the sales trend for a real estate developer involved in building subdivisions in a suburban area.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg6_785.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Other national economic data that could have a close relationship to business trends in an industry could include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gross national product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gross domestic product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consumer price index</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disposable personal income</p>
</li>
<li><p>Durable goods expenditures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unemployment rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interest rates/monetary policy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all economic indicators will affect all companies. Through discussions with the business owner(s) and a study of the industry of which the company is a part, the valuator can generally determine which economic indicators might provide a potential cause and effect relationship regarding sales and/or growth of the subject company.</p>
<p>Regional economic issues are also factors. For example, when valuing an optical shop in a small community, it would be important to know that the largest employer in the area was closing its doors. In conjunction with regional issues, it is also important to be aware of how the subject company compares to the competition. Does the subject company command a large market share compared to competitors, or is it less able to compete in the current market?</p>
<p>Knowledge of the product is also important. If the business being valued produces a &#8220;fad&#8221; product and has no other products in the pipeline, insight into the lifecycle of that product would be important.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>The Book Value of the Stock and the Financial Condition of the Business</h3>
<p>This is where the analyst goes to work. Revenue Ruling 59-60 &#167;4.02(c) states that two or more years of balance sheets immediately preceding the valuation date need to be acquired as well as a balance sheet of the month immediately preceding the given date. Using these statements, it is important to determine the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Liquidity position (using the current ratio)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Working capital (paying particular attention to the composition of the balance of current assets)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gross and net book value of principal classes of fixed assets (paying particular attention to age of the assets and change in fixed assets for the years in the data set)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Long-term indebtedness (paying particular attention to the timing of the future debt repayments)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Capital structure (paying particular attention to the balance of current debt, long-term debt, and equity used to finance operations and long-term acquisitions)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Net worth (paying particular attention to the ability to finance replacement/expansion through the use of equity, as well as dividend-paying ability)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>When examining the balance sheet, the business valuator needs to determine whether there are any non-operating assets listed. If so, such items should be removed from the balance sheet for the valuation of the basic operations, revalued at market value, and added back to the estimated value determined for the operations of the company.</p>
<p>If there is more than one class of stock, it is important for the business valuator to determine:</p>

<img src="common/custom-images/magnifier_on.gif" alt="magnifier image"/>
<p>the voting powers of the various classes,</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/magnifier_on.gif" alt="magnifier image"/>
<p>the dividend preferences (if any), and</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/magnifier_on.gif" alt="magnifier image"/>
<p>liquidation preferences (if any).</p>

<h3>The Earning Capacity of the Company</h3>
<p>Revenue Ruling 59-60 states that detailed, representative income statements for a period of preferably five or more years immediately preceding the valuation date need to be acquired. It is important to review the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Gross revenue by principle items:</b> This is important so that the business valuator can determine the lifecycle and potential of the products or services sold by the organization. Principle expenses include operating expenses, interest expense, depreciation, officer's salaries, contributions, taxes, and non-operating costs. It is important that the valuator determine whether these categories are reasonable and industry or region appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Net income and net income available for dividends:</b> Since value is closely tied to profitability, it is important to examine the profit capacity of the organization as well as determine whether the organization has the cash flow necessary to pay dividends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Rates and amounts of dividends paid on each class of stock:</b> This is perhaps one of the trickier areas of the valuation since many small companies try to avoid the double taxation of dividends by increasing officer's income and reducing dividends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Level of profits retained in the business:</b> It is important to determine whether the company is retaining enough of the profits in the organization to support growth without the need for external financing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.02(d-f)</p>
</p><br/>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg9_830.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Since it is often future benefits that are purchased when a business changes hands, it is important to look at the future earnings capacity for the subject company. Because conditions generally do not change quickly, the earnings of the past are often, by and large, a reliable guide to the profitability of the future.</p>
<p>Revenue Ruling 59-60 cautions not to resort to five- or ten-year averages without considering current trends. For example, if the sales of the main product produced by the subject company showed rapid growth in the first four years and for the next three years exhibited a leveling off of that growth, more weight should be put on the most recent years when determining the future earnings power of the organization. (Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.02(d))</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>The focus of the analysis of the historic profitability of the subject company is on risk. Two important questions to ask would be:</p>

<img src="common/custom-images/question_on.gif" alt="question image"/>
<p>How has the company performed in the past?</p>
<br/>

<img src="common/custom-images/question_on.gif" alt="question image"/>
<p>Is that experience likely to continue in the future?</p>
<br/>
<p>One of the analysis tools often introduced in a beginning managerial accounting course is that of the common sized statement. Such a review of the available income statements can provide a number of insights into the operations of the valued business. It is important to remember to remove any items from the historic data that are not likely to recur in the future before such a study is begun (normalization process).</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>The Dividend-Paying Capacity</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_2a_14.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Unlike publicly held companies, the dividend-paying capacity of a closely held organization may not be the same as the dividends actually paid. It is not unusual for a family held company to base dividend payments on the cash needs of the owners and/or their wish to avoid double taxation. Therefore, it is not a good practice to base the dividend-paying capacity on past practices when valuing a closely held company. The decision to pay dividends, increase salaries, or pay bonuses are at the discretion of the majority stockholder(s).</p>
<p>Care must be taken when reviewing the net income level and dividend payments. It is not unusual for a closely held organization to manipulate earnings and dividend levels to obtain desired results. For example, in order to avoid the double taxation of dividends, the majority owner of a small business can increase the officer's salary or bonus in order to keep the equity level at a specified debt to equity balance by not paying dividends.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>If the analyst plans to compare the earnings of a closely held business with those of a publicly held company, the earnings of the closely held business may have to be <i>normalized</i> for a useful comparison to be made. The earnings records of many closely held businesses often contain items that are not related to operations or operating assets, especially if the company is managed by the owners. It is not uncommon for a closely held business run as a sole proprietorship to have a mingling of business and personal expenses. The main objective of the normalizing adjustments is to more closely reflect the company's true economic position and results of operations. By normalizing the company's financial statements, a more accurate estimate of the fair market value of the business through the use of guidelines or projected earnings is possible.</p>
<p>Normalized financial statements should be useful for making comparisons, meaningful projections, and forecasts resulting in the determination of a reasonable market value for the subject company. The theory behind normalization adjustments is to restate the subject company's financial statements to better reflect economic reality, resulting in a more realistic estimate of the fair market value of the business.</p>
<p>Through the use of normalization adjustments, the valuator is better able to determine how the subject company:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>might have performed under normal conditions,</p>
</li>
<li><p>would realistically compare to a guideline organization, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>might be expected to perform in the future based on the performance of the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>The Determination of the Existence of Goodwill or Other Intangible Assets</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_image03.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Goodwill is the value above the fair value of the net assets that a buyer is willing to pay for the purchase of a company. It is thought to be created by the reputation of the organization and advantages that it has over the competition. The more profitable a company is in relation to what is considered to be a fair return on the operating assets, the greater the goodwill. The valuator must consider whether the reputation might be subject to a key man discount.</p>
<p>If business value could be calculated by using nothing more than the net liquidation value of the assets, business valuation would be easy and done by appraisers. However, it is the existence of intangible assets that makes business valuation more of an art than a science. Just what value does a trade name or brand name recognition have?</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Sales of the Stock and the Size of the Block of Stock to be Valued</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg12_850.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Occasionally the stock of closely held corporations changes hands. It is important to determine whether such sales were arm's-length transactions, forced sales, or distressed sales. Non-arm's-length sales are not likely to be good representations of value. For example, if a minority stockholder is in need of cash, he or she is likely to be willing to sell his/her shares to another individual for an amount less than fair market value. A minority stockholder of a closely held organization might be willing to pay well over the fair market value for additional stock if that purchase would put him/her in a majority position.</p>
<h3>The Market Price of Stocks of Corporations Engaged in the Same or Similar Line of Business Having Their Stock Actively Traded in a Free and Open Market, Either on an Exchange or Over-the-Counter</h3>
<p>It is very clearly stated in Revenue Ruling 59-60 that, when valuing the stock of a closely held company, the sale of actively traded stock of publicly held organizations in the same industry should be taken into consideration. Not only should the possible guideline company be in the same line of business, the balance sheet structure of the two organizations should be similar. For example, if a closely held company has used bank debt and common equity as funding sources, it would not be comparable to a publicly traded organization that has used common stock, preferred stock, bank loans, and bond issues as funding sources. Therefore, it is important that the guideline company be similar in many ways to the subject organization, such as products or services produced, balance sheet structure, markets served, and recent growth experience rates. It is through the steps described in this section that the valuator gains enough information about the subject company in order to begin the search for guideline companies.</p>

<h1><div id="title"> 
2 B. Beginning the Search for Guideline Companies 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Finding a Guideline Company</h2>
<h3>North American Industry Classification System Codes</h3>
<p>A good starting point when searching for guideline companies is to determine the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the firm being valued. These codes are used by various Federal statistical agencies for the function of collecting, analyzing, and distributing statistical data related to numerous industries throughout North America. Replacing the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system in 1997, NAICS codes were developed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico so that there would be a significant degree of comparability in various business statistics within North America. The U.S. NAICS Manual can be extremely helpful in that it contains definitions of each industry as well as potentially valuable background information. The official U.S. Government website (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch) provides useful and current information related to the available NAICS references and tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Online Searches</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_2b_21.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>A leading set of sources for finding potential guidelines would include online databases and searches of the industry. Websites and industry association publications provide a wealth of information that can be useful when conducting a search for such firms. Although some sources will supply little more than company names, it is possible&#8212;through additional searching or through the use of more sophisticated databases&#8212;to find information about potential guidelines, such as location, sales, solvency, and net income. It is often desirable to visit the website of a potential guideline organization in order to obtain more detailed information.</p>
<p>Using the information from these sources, it is then possible to develop a list of publicly traded companies that are in a similar business. It is from this list that an attempt to find guideline public firms needs to be made.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Determining the Number of Guidelines</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_image04.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>The courts have rejected the use of only one company as a comparable &#8212; &#8220;One company does not a comparable make&#8221; (<i>Estate of Joyce C. Hall,</i> 92 T.C. No. 19 (1989)). The more similar the guideline companies are to the closely held business, the fewer guidelines that are needed, with a key factor being the level of market trading activity for the guideline firms. Generally, it is desirable to have four to seven comparable companies.</p>
<h2>Factors to Consider</h2>
<p>Before public companies&#8212;i.e., the stocks of which are actively traded in a public market&#8212;can be used as guidelines, a mix of qualitative and quantitative factors must be taken into account. Again, the possible guideline company's website may contain more detailed information about their products, market segments, geographic regions, and other statistics. Does the guideline company serve a similar customer base with similar products or services to that of the subject organization? A multinational company would hardly be a comparable company to one that serves only the New England area.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Size is often a major difference between a closely held organization and a publicly traded company. Wal-Mart&#174; cannot be compared to a small family owned retail establishment serving a little neighborhood. An extremely large company cannot be considered to be comparable to a small, closely held one. What makes a possible guideline too large? One of the rules of thumb that is often used by valuators is to select a possible group of guideline companies that have sales no larger than 10 to 25 times the sales volume of the company being valued.</p>
<p>The important point here is that whatever the acceptable size difference, it is essential the companies also have similar products or markets as well as similar asset structures. For example, a guideline cannot use financing sources not available to the subject company, such as the sale of bonds.</p>
<h3>Financial Reporting and Normalization</h3>
<p>The valuator also needs to be aware of differences in how financial results are reported, or of the existence of unusual events. For example, if the subject company uses a FIFO inventory method and the possible guideline uses a LIFO inventory method, then an adjustment needs to be made so that the financials being compared use the same inventory valuation method. Another area where normalization adjustments might be required would include dealing with different depreciation methods, e.g., the firm being valued depreciates its fixed assets using the straight-line method while the guideline companies use an alternative approach such as an accelerated method. Also, if a company has a significant amount of operating leases there will be an artificially low enterprise value as the lease-based debt is ignored and also would have a correspondingly low EBITA since rental expenses would include interest costs. This can be adjusted for by adding the value of the lease to the market value of the debt and an implied interest expense to EBITA.</p>
<p>The information for such an adjustment is generally found in the notes to the financial statements. Another frequently needed adjustment would be one for an extraordinary event. Such an adjustment would be made to improve the comparability of the organizations. Often the closely held company's financial statements will need to be normalized.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>Operating Trends</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img4.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>The next step in the search for a guideline company is to look for similar trends in operating performance. If the sales of the closely held organization had shown a healthy increase over the last few years, and the sales of a possible guideline showed a steep decline, then it is unlikely that the two organizations are operating in markets that react to various economic factors in a similar fashion. Also, even if both firms have been growing, the growth for one may have been due to acquisitions while the growth for the company being valued might have come from increased sales at existing locations; therefore, in both cases described, the potential guideline company would not provide a good comparison.</p>
<p>As noted above, size is often the major difference between a closely held organization and a publicly traded company. To deal with this problem, the valuator may wish to search for similar companies for which deals have recently been completed (purchases or mergers) that are not publicly traded companies. This is what is referred to as the Guideline Transaction Method. This may allow the valuator to overcome the size issue, but care must be taken to ensure that the level of detailed transaction information is available for the firm so that sufficient operating results can be determined.</p>

<h2>Ratio Analysis</h2>
<p>Continuing with our analysis of the dwindling list of possible guideline companies, size and ratio analysis can provide a further verification as to whether a particular publicly traded company or guideline transaction company can be a reasonably comparable.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following example. You have been tasked with finding guideline companies for a grocery store. Using just a few of the possible ratios that can be easily calculated, and dealing with grocery stores with up to $1 million in annual sales, you can narrow down the list of potential guideline firms. You put together a comparison of the sales levels of the subject company and three possible guidelines as shown in the following table:</p>
<div style="margin-top:14px;">
<table class="lt" width="650">
<tr>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Ratio&#160;</th>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Closely Held Company</th>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Company A</th>

    <td align="center" valign="top">$ 625,000</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">$ 850,000</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>All of the possible guidelines fall within the size criterion, ranging from 1.3 times to just over twice the size of the subject firm. Through the use of ratios in the following categories, these three potential companies can be examined further.</p>

<h3>Liquidity Ratios</h3>
<p>Liquidity measures the adequacy of an organization's working capital (current assets) to meet the current obligations. In other words, does an organization have enough cash or other current assets that can be quickly turned into cash?</p>
<p><b>Current ratio</b> The current ratio focuses on the current assets that are available to honor the current liabilities that are incurred as a result of normal operations. The current ratio is a relative comparison of current assets to current liabilities. It calculates the number of dollars of current assets that are available to cover each dollar of current liabilities</p>
<p>Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities</p>
<p><b>The accounts receivable turnover ratio</b> The accounts receivable turnover ratio measures the quality and liquidity of the accounts receivable.</p>
<p>Accounts Receivable Turnover = Net Credit Sales/Average Accounts Receivable</p>
<p>The quality of the receivables is defined as collection without losses. It is assumed that the longer the receivables are outstanding, the less likely that they will be collected. The turnover is an indicator of the age of the receivables. It indicates how many times, on average, the receivables revolve (how many times they are generated and collected during the year). The credit terms should determine an expected turnover rate. For example, if the credit terms are net 60, it would be expected that the turnover would be six times if receivables were actually collected within the 60 days. A low actual ratio in comparison to the expected ratio may indicate the possibility of collection problems</p>
<p><b>The working capital turnover ratio</b> The working capital turnover ratio measures the sales created through the use of net working capital. Cash and accounts payable are used to purchase inventory that is then sold. Other current assets and current liabilities are used or incurred to support operations necessary to create sales</p>
<p>Working Capital Turnover = Sales/Net Working Capital</p>
<p>In other words, this ratio measures how effectively management uses current funds to create sales. A higher ratio in comparison to net working capital is preferred.</p>
<p><b>Inventory turnover ratio</b> The inventory turnover ratio measures the speed with which inventory can be converted into sales. In other words, the control that management has over inventory is assessed. The quality of the inventory is determined by the company's ability to use and dispose of inventory without a loss</p>
<p>Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold/Average Inventory</p>
</p><br/>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img5.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Since inventories are purchased for the purpose of obtaining a return, it is extremely important to determine if corrective action needs to be taken. Excessive inventories can lead to high storage and insurance costs, a greater risk of obsolescence, physical deterioration, or theft, tying up funds that could be used in a more productive fashion. This leads to decreased profits</p>
<p>Different inventory cost flow assumptions (FIFO vs. LIFO) can produce widely different inventory valuations and, thus, different turnover ratios. This can also lead to comparison problems between organizations. Therefore, when comparing the subject company to possible guidelines, it is important to be sure that the data is normalized, if necessary, to provide the same cost flow assumption for the companies being compared.</p>

<h3>Solvency Ratios</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg20_1120.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Solvency is the organization's ability to meet long-term obligations (repayment of principal and interest) through the use of cash, or by converting non-cash assets into cash. Solvency ratios focus on whether a company can survive over the long-term and are closely related to financial risk. As the financing of the organization shifts from equity financing towards debt financing, the risk that the firm could default on long-term obligations increases. Solvency is also a matter of degree. A lack of solvency could lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the inability to refinance long-term debt at favorable rates, thus leading to lower profitability, or</p>
</li>
<li><p>a greater risk of defaulting on current maturities that could lead to bankruptcy and liquidation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial leverage is created when a portion of the company's assets are obtained through the use of credit (rather than cash) to finance the purchase; therefore, solvency is also related to the measurement of the use of leverage.</p>

<p><b>The debt to equity ratio</b> The debt to equity ratio measures the relationship of debt to capital sources. The ratio of the dollars of debt per dollar of equity is determined. It shows the degree to which stockholders have a stake in the organization.</p>
<p>Debt to Equity = Total Debt/Total Stockholder Equity</p>
<p>The company's ability to meet long-term obligations is measured. From a creditor's point of view, the lower the ratio, the lower the risk of insolvency.</p>
<p><b>The times interest earned ratio</b> The times interest earned ratio measures the ability of the company to cover interest charges. This is important because, at minimum, a company would need to pay current interest charges</p>

<h3>Profitability Ratios</h3>
<p>Profitability is the measure of success in terms of income defined by varying means over a period of time. In analyzing profitability, earnings are compared to a base such as sales, productive assets, or equity. Increased profitability provides the potential for increased dividend payments and stock appreciation. Increased profitability also provides greater security for debt holders.</p>
<p><b>The asset turnover ratio</b> The asset turnover ratio indicates how many dollars of sales were created by each dollar of total assets. It helps to determine whether the available assets were used efficiently to create sales. The goal of management is to create the highest possible amount of sales per dollar of invested capital. Note that a reasonable range for this ratio may be determined for each industry.</p>
<p>Asset Turnover = Sales/Average Assets</p>
<p><b>The return on assets ratio</b> The return on assets ratio measures the productivity of assets in terms of producing income. This ratio depends upon the organization's ability to get a high profit from each sales dollar while creating high sales per dollar of invested capital. A consistently high ROA is an indication that management is making effective decisions, and that the organization is a &#8220; growth company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Return Assets = Income/Average Total Assets</p>
</p><br/>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>As in all turnover ratios, a high asset turnover is a desirable outcome as that would result from the effective use of available assets. Comparison between firms within an industry can be difficult due to the fact that the age of the assets used in the production of the sales may vary. This is a limitation caused by the use of historical costs, as opposed to current values for the productive assets. There is also a problem when comparing a capital-intensive firm to a labor-intensive one.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Applying these ratios to the subject company and the three possible guidelines results in the following:</p>

<p>Yet again, Company A does not appear to be an acceptable guideline to the subject organization. The important point to remember here is that the calculation of these ratios provides information about the subject company to the business valuator. The results of these calculations for the subject company must compare reasonably well to the calculations of those same ratios for potential comparable organization to remain on the list of possible guideline companies.</p>
<p>In the example, analysis of this nature, using quantitative factors, would suggest that Companies B and C may be comparable to the subject organization; thus, accepting them as potential guideline organizations. A similar analysis of key ratios should be performed for any company deemed to be a potential guideline. Such an exercise will help determine the range within which measurements for the closely held company should fall relative to the averages of the group of guideline companies.</p>

<p>Once financial comparability is established and a group of guideline publicly traded companies have been chosen, the next step is to do a step-by-step comparison of the closely held firm with each of the guidelines to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of the subject firm. Finally, if sufficient guideline companies have been found, the process culminates with the development of a &#8220;value measure&#8221; that can be applied to a specific variable of the closely held company to determine its estimated value. Such value measures are generally focused on some measure of earnings or invested capital. In our example, &#8220;earnings after tax&#8221; is used.

<h2>Guideline Transaction Method</h2>
<p>Since the Guideline Public method uses publicly held firms as guidelines, information about these potential comparable organizations is readily available. Unfortunately the mere size, scope, and depth of operations of these public companies often makes them poor guidelines when valuing a small, closely held firm. However, in recent years, the ease of database technology has allowed for the establishment of databases&#8212;such as Done Deals, BIZCOMPS, Pratt's Stats, etc.&#8212;that contain information regarding actual sales of private companies, which would be companies that often are closer matches to the firm being valued.</p>
<p>There are potential problems introduced when using these databases. Often, there are no audited statements available, and the financial statement provided for the potential guideline company on these databases may include GAAP errors; thus, leading to potential comparability issues.</p>
<p>Once similar private companies included in one of the transaction databases have been found, an appropriate multiple or value measure needs to be determined and calculated such as was done in the above example using publicly held organizations. These value multiples are market-derived factors used to determine the value of a business or ownership interest, and can be based on several different benefit streams or other variables. Some commonly used multiples would include:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Price/Earnings (last 12 months or most recent year)</p>
</li>

<p>During the process of finding guideline transactions that seem to be well-suited to the subject of the valuation, it is also necessary to look at factors such as the reason for the potential guideline transaction being considered. Often, the name of the buyer will provide information. For example, if the purchase is for synergistic purposes, the price paid by the buyer might be inflated due to the specific gains that would accrue specifically to that buyer and not be available to a generic purchaser. Also, the purchase might be related to a forced liquidation in bankruptcy, which could tend to significantly reduce the sale price of the firm.</p>
<p>Once some number of companies found in the transactions databases have been established to meet the standards to be included as a guideline, the next step is to determine the appropriate multiple(s) and calculate the value as described in the example shown above using the Guideline Public Method. One good way to select the appropriate multiple(s) is to choose the multiple or multiples that are most tightly clustered in the industry of which the subject company is a part. This type of multiple would tend to be the most appropriate one to use in a value estimate. A wide dispersion of multiples often indicates a Valuation Ratio might not be meaningful for a particular industry. A Valuation Ratio is defined as a &#8220;fraction in which a value or price serves as numerator and financial, operating, or physical data serves as denominator.&#8221; (<b>International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms</b>, June 2001) The calculation value using multiples is demonstrated below.</p>
<p>Assume the median measures for guideline companies chosen from a transaction database are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MVIC/Sales &#8211; 0.697 (MVIC = market value of invested capital);</p>
</li>
<li><p>MVIC/EBITDA &#8211; 5.817 (EBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization); and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Equity Price/Earnings &#8211; 13.00.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is information about the subject company:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normalized sales &#8211; $34,389,893;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Long-term Debt &#8211; $5,756,374;</p>
</li>
<li><p>EBITDA &#8211; $4,160,881; and</p>

<p>Here we see that the estimated value for the first two measures is very similar but the value for the P/E ratio is significantly different. As a result, the analyst could consider that the Price/Earnings measure is not reliable to use in a valuation calculation for this particular industry.</p>
<p>If after determining several appropriate multiples, the results of a potential value for the subject company results in a wide range of results, the analyst might determine that the use of a guideline method is not appropriate since the wide dispersion of values cannot be easily explained nor reconciled. Delaware Chancery Court cited &#8220;Law of One Price&#8221;, concluding that a broad range of values resulting from comparables analysis to be too unreliable to be given significant weight. (<i>Cede &amp; Co. v. JRC Acquisition Corp., 2004 WL 286963</i> and <i>U.S. Cellular Operating Co., 2005 WL 43994.</i>) The <i>Law of One Price</i> is an economic term that states that in an efficient market all identical goods must have only one price, net of the price of transferring goods between the markets.</p>

2 D. Finding Guideline Companies 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>When there are operating and nonoperating assets, returns from both types of assets must be considered. Except in the case of liquidation, the value is generally based on an expected future return since the business investor, like any other investor, is purchasing the right to future earnings.</p>
<p>To find potential guideline firms, it is necessary to obtain financial information about the firms that might be comparable. Finding such companies is an easier job today than just a number of years ago:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>First, there are a larger number of publicly traded companies to choose from.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Second, there are more small companies being traded on the open market&#8212;particularly NASDAQ&#8212;and smaller companies tend to be more comparable to closely held companies.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Third, many data sources have been developed that can facilitate obtaining basic financial information about these firms&#8212;and help the analyst determine the necessary discount for lack of marketability and the control premium.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>There are numerous resources available to aid the business valuator when searching for potential guideline organizations. For example, databases available over the Internet&#8212;or published on various optical storage media (e.g., CDs, or DVDs)&#8212;can provide historical information of five years or more for thousands of publicly traded firms along with the capacity of developing individual and aggregate ratios for a chosen group of firms or by industry. Other databases provide information on private firms; however, such records must be used with extreme caution since accuracy and/or consistency may be lacking. There is a great deal of data available, making the search for potential guideline organizations much easier than in the past.</p>

<h1><div id="title"> 
2 E. Problems with Guidelines 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>Asset size is one of the variables most likely to eliminate many potential firms as possible guideline companies. Without considering anything else, size does not cause a problem, but it often serves as a proxy for other issues which set firms in the same line of business apart from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The firms in our previous example have similar debt-to-equity ratios, but the question often relates to type and availability of credit. Many large publicly traded firms have access to the bond market to raise funds, while some privately held companies might qualify for nothing more than a bank loan, which is limited by the personal guarantee of the owner. The issue here would relate to the ease of access to additional credit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many closely held businesses do not have&#8212;and cannot afford&#8212;the depth of management available to larger organizations. The owner of the small firm often wears many hats (e.g., CEO, engineer, accountant, human resource manager, marketing manager, etc.) compared to the larger firm, which has qualified individuals in each functional area. There is also greater risk in terms of succession in smaller firms. If the CEO of a larger organization dies or becomes incapacitated, there generally are qualified replacements available. If the owner/manager of the small firm dies, however, the company might be forced to liquidate, because there is often no one available to fill this individual's roles. The inheriting family members might not have the skills or desire necessary to keep the firm operating.</p>
<p>Closely held firms often produce only one&#8212;or no more than a few&#8212;products. As firms grow, they often diversify into different product lines in order to reduce the risk of having &#8220;all one's eggs in the same basket.&#8221; It is questionable if a single-product firm can be compared to a multifaceted company, even if they are in the same NAICS category.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_image07.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>A closely held firm is frequently a small competitor and generally a follower rather than a leader in the industry. The subject firm most likely serves only the wholesale or retail segments of the business, while potential guidelines might serve both market segments. A potential guideline company might concentrate its activities in the segment not served by the firm being valued. In addition, a small firm that serves customers in a single geographic region of the United States might not be comparable to a firm that has a broad international customer base.</p>
<p>Publicly traded companies often pay dividends; however, most closely held organizations do not. The closely held corporation frequently increases the owner/manager's salary and benefits in lieu of dividends in order to avoid the double taxation of dividends. This compensation issue introduces an additional question concerning the possible need to normalize the financial statements of a closely held firm before they can be used in the valuation process. The normalization process is outside the scope of this course.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>These are the types of issues that courts and the IRS might raise when questioning the valuator's choice of guidelines. Many of the issues require subjective choices, and not all courts or IRS agents would rule the same in all circumstances. This may allow the valuator a degree of flexibility in defining what would be a similar firm, and unfortunately a biased valuator can potentially select guideline companies that will provide a sought-after result.</p>
<p>The potential exists that it will not be possible to find a sufficient number of guideline firms to use a method that utilizes guidelines in the valuation process.</p>
<p>Before the analyst can proceed in using other alternative approaches for valuation of estate- or gift-tax cases, it must be demonstrated that:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>an adequate number of guideline firms cannot be found, and</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(2)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>that the analysis procedures previously described provided the basis for arriving at this conclusion.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This has been a brief introduction to business valuation and the use of guidelines. Remember, the provisions of Revenue Ruling 59-60 and Regulations 20.2031-1(b) and 25.2512-1 suggest that it is desirable to base a business valuation upon historical facts that result in the use of guidelines. Although guideline firms are often difficult to find, the use of databases and Internet sources has made this once onerous task much easier than in the past. Care should be used to be sure to understand what is included in the data groupings found on the various databases. There often are questions related to consistency of date and data. The statements being compared need to be from the same approximate period, and an in-depth analysis needs to be performed on these financials looking carefully at such things as depreciation methods used, sources of financing, inventory valuation methods used, etc. Definitions vary from database to database for such items as ratios; therefore, a valuator needs to compare information with care.</p>
<p>Since the stock prices of publicly traded companies are the result of numerous trades by willing buyers and sellers, the exchange prices are considered objective. Business valuations that can be based upon the use of publicly traded guidelines can provide an effective valuation method supportable through the use of verifiable data. However, there are those who feel that a publicly traded company cannot be comparable to a closely held organization due to differences in size, capital structure, ability to obtain funding, diversity of markets, or diversification of products. In addition, the publicly traded stock price is based upon the sale of a minority interest, whereas the sale of an entire closely held company would represent a majority interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_2e_52.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<p>Using market multiples for a business valuation is a convenient approach. They represent a deceptively simple approach to business valuation and are often desired by courts and regulatory agencies. A disadvantage to this approach is that they do not cause the valuator to be required to think about the economic factors and firm specific variables impacting the subject company. Problems arise as the analysis moves further down the income statement (e.g., to net earnings) where the values are significantly more distorted than those further up the statement due to some of the issues inherent in GAAP.</p>
<p>Even with all the factors that make using the guideline methods problematic, the legal system generally requires that a genuine attempt be made to find either Guideline Public companies or Guideline Transactions before the market approach can be eliminated as a viable alternative for a particular valuation, and the valuator must supply documented reasons for bypassing the use of a market method in a particular business valuation.</p>
