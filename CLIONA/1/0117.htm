<p>Using market multiples for a business valuation is a convenient approach. They represent a deceptively simple approach to business valuation and are often desired by courts and regulatory agencies. A disadvantage to this approach is that they do not cause the valuator to be required to think about the economic factors and firm specific variables impacting the subject company. Problems arise as the analysis moves further down the income statement (e.g., to net earnings) where the values are significantly more distorted than those further up the statement due to some of the issues inherent in GAAP.</p>
<p>Even with all the factors that make using the guideline methods problematic, the legal system generally requires that a genuine attempt be made to find either Guideline Public companies or Guideline Transactions before the market approach can be eliminated as a viable alternative for a particular valuation, and the valuator must supply documented reasons for bypassing the use of a market method in a particular business valuation.</p>
