<h3>More reasons</h3>
<p>There are other reasons for valuing a closely held business:</p>
<h3>Initial public offerings</h3>
<p>A company's stock needs to be valued prior to an initial public offering. These companies often are small organizations that were developed around a particular product or service and are expected to experience rapid growth. Outside funding (through a public stock offering) is often necessary to support that growth.</p>
<h3>Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)</h3>
<p>An ESOP's stock has to be valued annually since the stock of the nonpublic company is used as additional compensation for employees. Since ESOPs come under federal regulation, the concept of fair market value is used when determining value.</p>
<h3>Damage determination</h3>
<p>Damage cases that relate to patent infringements, breaches of contract, wrongful death action, etc., often require a business valuation in order to determine the actual damages suffered. The definition of value can vary among different damage categories and jurisdictions. The business valuator should study the legal precedents that apply to the valuation in question.</p>
<h3>Spin-offs</h3>
<p>Sometimes a partial valuation is prepared if a segment of a closely held business is spun off.</p>
