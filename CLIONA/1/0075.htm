<h3>The Dividend-Paying Capacity</h3>

<p>Unlike publicly held companies, the dividend-paying capacity of a closely held organization may not be the same as the dividends actually paid. It is not unusual for a family held company to base dividend payments on the cash needs of the owners and/or their wish to avoid double taxation. Therefore, it is not a good practice to base the dividend-paying capacity on past practices when valuing a closely held company. The decision to pay dividends, increase salaries, or pay bonuses are at the discretion of the majority stockholder(s).</p>
<p>Care must be taken when reviewing the net income level and dividend payments. It is not unusual for a closely held organization to manipulate earnings and dividend levels to obtain desired results. For example, in order to avoid the double taxation of dividends, the majority owner of a small business can increase the officer's salary or bonus in order to keep the equity level at a specified debt to equity balance by not paying dividends.</p>
