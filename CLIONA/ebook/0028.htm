<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">The AICPA&#39;s <i>Code of Professional Conduct</i> requires CPAs to be objective when performing professional services. A CPA is expected to be impartial and free of conflicts of interest. SSVS No. 1 states that the CPA performing valuation services is expected to follow the AICPA's <i>Code of Professional Conduct</i> regarding objectivity.</p>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>quote</b></span></p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">A member in public practice or his or her firm may be faced with a conflict of interest when performing a professional service. In determining whether a professional service, relationship or matter would result in a conflict of interest, a member should use professional judgment, taking into account whether a reasonable and informed third party who is aware of the relevant information would conclude that a conflict of interest exists.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">A conflict of interest creates adverse interest and self-interest threats to the member&#39;s compliance with the Integrity and Objectivity rule. For example, threats may be created when:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:18px;">
<li><p>the member or the member&#39;s firm provides a professional service related to a particular matter involving two or more clients whose interests with respect to that matter are in conflict; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>the interests of the member or the member&#39;s firm with respect to a particular matter and the interests of the client for whom the member or the member&#39;s firm provides a professional service related to that matter are in conflict.</p>
</li>
</ul>
