<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">If the analyst plans to compare the earnings of a closely held business with those of a publicly held company, the earnings of the closely held business may have to be <i>normalized</i> for a useful comparison to be made. The earnings records of many closely held businesses often contain items that are not related to operations or operating assets, especially if the company is managed by the owners. It is not uncommon for a closely held business run as a sole proprietorship to have a mingling of business and personal expenses. The main objective of the normalizing adjustments is to more closely reflect the company's true economic position and results of operations. By normalizing the company's financial statements, a more accurate estimate of the fair market value of the business through the use of guidelines or projected earnings is possible.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">Normalized financial statements should be useful for making comparisons, meaningful projections, and forecasts resulting in the determination of a reasonable market value for the subject company. The theory behind normalization adjustments is to restate the subject company's financial statements to better reflect economic reality, resulting in a more realistic estimate of the fair market value of the business.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">Through the use of normalization adjustments, the valuator is better able to determine how the subject company:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:18px;">
<li><p>might have performed under normal conditions,</p>
</li>
<li><p>would realistically compare to a guideline organization, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>might be expected to perform in the future based on the performance of the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
