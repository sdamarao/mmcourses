To receive your certificate of completion, you must provide evidence of
your satisfactory completion of the tests by registering with Thomson Reuters.
To register, you must first be connected to the internet and then press the "Register
Credit‚Äù button.<br><br>You will then receive access to your certificate of completion and have the opportunity to give
feedback on your experience.<br><br>If you are unable to connect to the internet at this time and like to come back later to
register your credit, press the "Save Now and Register Later" button.
This will save your progress until you will be able to connect to the internet. When you do register, your certificate will reflect the date of your completion, not the date of your subsequent registration.<br><br>
