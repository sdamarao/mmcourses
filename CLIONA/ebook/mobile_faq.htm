<div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >What can I expect to see in my course?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >Each course contains study questions that check your comprehension of the preceding material. Some courses will also contain practice exercises to help you apply certain concepts. At the end of the course you will be given an exam. You must pass the exam in order to pass the course and obtain your CPE certificate.<br><br>Some courses contain audio and/or video clips. These courses are labeled, "&nbsp;&nbsp;A premium Course"&nbsp;&nbsp;. Each video segment allows you to select a low- or high-bandwidth presentation. Low-bandwidth will present audio with still shots. High-bandwidth will present video with sound. To run the video optimally, you should have access to a Wi-Fi, broadband or high-speed internet connection (network, cable, DSL or fiber). If you select "&nbsp;&nbsp;high-bandwidth"&nbsp;&nbsp; but experience excessively long download times or jerkiness while the video is running, you may not have enough bandwidth (slow speed or too much traffic online) to view the video. You should stop the video and select "&nbsp;&nbsp;low-bandwidth"&nbsp;&nbsp; option. A transcript for all audio and video segments is available for every course. </div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >Do I have to start on page one and take the course in order?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" > While we recommend that you work your way through the chapters in the order they appear, you may choose to go to any chapter at any time by opening the Course Outline box and selecting the desired chapter. </div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >How long do I have to complete my course?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" > Generally, you are allowed one year from the date of purchase to successfully complete the course. However, certain courses have hard-coded expiration dates due to particular state or other jurisdiction rules. When this is true of any course, you will see that hard-stop date in the course description.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >Can I exit in the middle of the course without completing it and come back to it later?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >Yes. Your progress will be saved and you will be brought back to where you left off any time you have to exit the course and return later. </div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >How will I know how much longer my course is going to take me?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" > Your progress can easily be seen by looking at the progress indicator which tracks your progress through the course and displays a percentage completed so far. </div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >What types of questions are in my course?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" > All study and exam questions are multiple choice. For the most part, these multiple choice questions have only one correct answer. Where more than one correct answer exists, you will be prompted to choose more than one answer option. <br><br> Some courses will contain additional learning exercises to help you practice certain skills. In these practice exercises, you may be asked to "&nbsp;&nbsp;drag and drop"&nbsp;&nbsp; words from one area of the screen to another, match lists of terms to their definitions, or put events or actions in the appropriate sequence. You will always be provided with the correct responses after you have completed these ungraded exercises.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >Are study questions and practice exercises graded?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" > You will not be graded on study questions or practice exercises.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >What type of test will I have to take, and how will I be graded?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" > At the end of the course, you will be given an exam. The exam will be graded after all questions have been answered and submitted for grading.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >What is the passing score for my course?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >Generally, a passing score is 70%. However, several states or jurisdictions have higher standards for certain types of courses, such as ethics-related courses. You can see the passing score percentage on the introduction page for the exam.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >If I pass my course, can I retake the exam to try to get a better score?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >No. Once you pass the course, you cannot retake the exam to improve your score.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >Will I get to see which exam questions I got wrong and which ones I got right?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >Once you pass the course, you will be given the option to review all exam questions along with your answers and, where applicable, the correct answer. Unlike study questions, due to NASBA policies, you will not receive any remedial or reinforcement feedback for exam questions.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >How many chances do I get to try to pass the exam?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >We do not put a limit on the number of times you may attempt the exam.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >When will I get my certificate?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >Your certificate is available as soon as you pass the course.</div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >Where can I find my certificate?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >For IEv8 (and below) users, after successfully completing the course, the Certificate button on the menu bar will be activated. You may access your certificate by clicking that button.<br><br> For IEv9 (and above) users, after successfully completing the course, the Certificate button will appear in the Course Outline and be active. You may access your certificate by selecting that button. <br><br> For all users, as always, you will be able to access your certificate on Checkpoint Learning. After logging into your account, select the "&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity History"&nbsp;&nbsp; tab , then select "&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificates & Documents"&nbsp;&nbsp; in the left-hand navigation panel. </div>
<br><div style="font-family:K-Medium;font-size:24px;" >How do I contact customer service?</div><div style="font-family:K-Light;font-size:18px;" >You may call customer service at 1-800-431-9025.</div>
