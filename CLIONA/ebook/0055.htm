<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">This method first appeared in ARM 34, which was published in 1920 by the U.S. Treasury Department (thus the name &#8220;Treasury Method&#8221;). This method was devised to estimate the intangible value of goodwill that breweries and distilleries lost because of Prohibition. This method has been widely used to estimate the value of businesses for gift tax, estate tax, and other taxation purposes. It is often used for valuing businesses and professional practices in divorce cases.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">The valuation method set out by the IRS in ARM 34 uses a formula approach. The theory behind this method is that the company's net tangible assets could be expected to earn a &#8220;normal profit&#8221; that was defined as an 8- to 10-percent return on those assets. Any profit above that normal return would be due to the fact that the business had intangible assets (goodwill).</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">The IRS suggested that those intangible assets could result in a 15- to 20-percent return. Although ARM 34 was originally developed for use with breweries and distilleries, this method has been used for companies in many types of industries. Over time, however, it has been determined that the rates as indicated in this memorandum are not appropriate for <i>all</i> companies, in <i>all</i> industries, in <i>all</i> situations. In fact, the IRS has become disenchanted with its own valuation method, and Revenue Ruling 68-609 was issued in an attempt to curb misinterpretations of the Treasury method.</p>
