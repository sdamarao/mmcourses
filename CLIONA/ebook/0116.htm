<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="margin-top:27px;">This has been a brief introduction to business valuation and the use of guidelines. Remember, the provisions of Revenue Ruling 59-60 and Regulations 20.2031-1(b) and 25.2512-1 suggest that it is desirable to base a business valuation upon historical facts that result in the use of guidelines. Although guideline firms are often difficult to find, the use of databases and Internet sources has made this once onerous task much easier than in the past. Care should be used to be sure to understand what is included in the data groupings found on the various databases. There often are questions related to consistency of date and data. The statements being compared need to be from the same approximate period, and an in-depth analysis needs to be performed on these financials looking carefully at such things as depreciation methods used, sources of financing, inventory valuation methods used, etc. Definitions vary from database to database for such items as ratios; therefore, a valuator needs to compare information with care.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">Since the stock prices of publicly traded companies are the result of numerous trades by willing buyers and sellers, the exchange prices are considered objective. Business valuations that can be based upon the use of publicly traded guidelines can provide an effective valuation method supportable through the use of verifiable data. However, there are those who feel that a publicly traded company cannot be comparable to a closely held organization due to differences in size, capital structure, ability to obtain funding, diversity of markets, or diversification of products. In addition, the publicly traded stock price is based upon the sale of a minority interest, whereas the sale of an entire closely held company would represent a majority interest.</p>
