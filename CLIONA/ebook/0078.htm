<h3>Sales of the Stock and the Size of the Block of Stock to be Valued</h3>

<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">Occasionally the stock of closely held corporations changes hands. It is important to determine whether such sales were arm's-length transactions, forced sales, or distressed sales. Non-arm's-length sales are not likely to be good representations of value. For example, if a minority stockholder is in need of cash, he or she is likely to be willing to sell his/her shares to another individual for an amount less than fair market value. A minority stockholder of a closely held organization might be willing to pay well over the fair market value for additional stock if that purchase would put him/her in a majority position.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;">The Market Price of Stocks of Corporations Engaged in the Same or Similar Line of Business Having Their Stock Actively Traded in a Free and Open Market, Either on an Exchange or Over-the-Counter</h3>
<p style="margin-top:27px;">It is very clearly stated in Revenue Ruling 59-60 that, when valuing the stock of a closely held company, the sale of actively traded stock of publicly held organizations in the same industry should be taken into consideration. Not only should the possible guideline company be in the same line of business, the balance sheet structure of the two organizations should be similar. For example, if a closely held company has used bank debt and common equity as funding sources, it would not be comparable to a publicly traded organization that has used common stock, preferred stock, bank loans, and bond issues as funding sources. Therefore, it is important that the guideline company be similar in many ways to the subject organization, such as products or services produced, balance sheet structure, markets served, and recent growth experience rates. It is through the steps described in this section that the valuator gains enough information about the subject company in order to begin the search for guideline companies.</p>
