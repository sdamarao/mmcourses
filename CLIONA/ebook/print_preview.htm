Such valuations are often needed for estate planning and gift tax purposes. The course explains key IRS rulings and court cases that often dictate the methods used in a given case. Both the IRS and the courts emphasize using historical facts instead of a valuation based on future projections. Because of the lack of a market value for a closely held company, it is useful and desirable to calculate the valuation based on the market value of a comparable publicly held company.</p>

<p>This chapter discusses the valuation of a closely held business, including issues concerning the Statement on Standards for Valuation Service No. 1, Revenue Ruling 59-60, fair market value, and the four basic approaches to valuing a closely held business.</p>
<h1 style="margin-top:27px;" >1 A. Defining a Closely Held Business</h1>
<h2>Investments</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg2_20.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Today, investors have a wide variety of investment alternatives, including financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds), commodities, real estate, and collectibles (such as artwork and rare coins). The investor's purchasing and selling decisions for these investments generally are based on the expectation of the possible returns that could be received&#8212;sometime in the future&#8212;for funds invested today. These possible returns are relative to the perceived riskiness of the investment. Hundreds of millions of shares of stock&#8212;and billions of dollars in bonds of publicly held corporations&#8212;are traded daily, providing nearly instantaneous information as to the market value of these assets.</p>
<p>This works well with publicly traded companies, but how does an investor determine the market value of an ownership interest in a closely held business whose stock is not exchanged on public markets?</p>
<br/><h2>Defining the Business Valuation</h2>
<p>On any given day, the value of investments sold on a public market can easily be determined. For example, if an individual held 10 shares of stock in <i>The Dover Company</i> on the date of his death that were selling for $50 per share on the open market, the IRS would determine the value of that investment would be $500 ($50 per share &#215; 10 shares) for estate tax purposes.</p>
<p>But what about the over 90% of the businesses in the United States that are closely held companies whose stock is not traded on public markets? The value for all or part of these organizations can be determined:</p>

<p>According to the definition in the <i>International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms</i> that appears in Appendix B of the <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i>, (SSVS No. 1) a business valuation is &#8220;the act or process of determining the value of a business enterprise or ownership interest therein.&#8221; (International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms, June 2001)</p>
<br/><h2>The History of Valuations</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_1a_4.jpg"/><br/>
<p>In the 1920s, the 18th Amendment was passed (prohibition), and businesses producing or serving alcoholic beverages&#8212;that were forced to close&#8212;had to calculate the value of their businesses in order to determine their losses for IRS purposes. Since there were numerous closely held organizations that would be reporting losses related to prohibition, the IRS provided valuation guidelines in a series of Appeals and Review Memorandums (ARMs) and Revenue Rulings. Revenue Ruling 59-60 presented a general approach for valuation. This ruling provided a general valuation method and list of factors to be considered in valuing shares of stock of closely held corporations for estate- and gift-tax purposes.</p>
<br/><h3>Revenue Ruling 59-60 (issued in 1959)</h3>
<p>Estate and gift taxes are only two reasons for determining the value of a closely held corporation. Revenue Ruling 59-60 provides a basis for <i>all</i> valuations. The methods discussed in this revenue ruling relate to valuing stock where market quotations are unavailable or occur so infrequently that they do not reflect fair market value. The same valuation principles presented in Revenue Ruling 59-60 for closely held corporations can be applied to unincorporated businesses. Revenue Ruling 59-60 defines a closely held corporation in Section 2 of its ruling.</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>Closely held corporations are those corporations the shares of which are owned by a relatively limited number of stockholders. Often the entire stock issue is held by one family. The result of this situation is that little, if any, trading in the shares takes place. There is, therefore, no established market for the stock and such sales as occur at irregular intervals seldom reflect all of the elements of a representative transaction as defined by the term &#8220;fair market value.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;2.03</p>

<br/><h2>Berg v. Commissioner</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img1.jpg"/><br/>
<p>In 1991, there was a landmark court case regarding business valuation&#8212;<i>Estate of Edgar A Berg v. Commissioner (T.C. Memo 1991-279)</i>. The two CPAs who provided the valuation for the Berg Estate were in academia. They did not have formal education in the area of business valuation, were not members of a business valuation or appraisal organization, and only made passing reference to a prior court case as support for their business valuation result. On the other hand, the IRS expert did have training in business valuation and used recognized studies of comparables to support the assets being valued. Until this time, the courts would often use the average of the business valuations presented by each side. However, in the <i>Berg</i> case, the court chose the IRS's position, since the report provided by its expert was comprehensive, logical, supported, and well presented. This case marked a change in how business valuations were approached, and it highlighted the importance of the background and education of the valuation analyst.</p>
<p>Estate of Edgar A. Berg v. Commissioner. 61 T.C. M. 2949 (1991)</p>
<br/><h2>New standards for business valuation</h2>
<p>In 2001, the AICPA began to develop a set of standards that defined the business valuation process and reporting. Over a period of six years, individuals from various AICPA committees&#8212;along with other experts in the business valuation and accounting fields&#8212;participated in the development of an Exposure Draft. The draft was issued in 2005 and then revised based upon comments received from professionals actively working in the business valuation area. A second draft was published in 2006.</p>
<p>On June 21, 2007, the AICPA issued the <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1, Valuation of a Business, Business Ownership Interest, Security, or Intangible Asset</i>. Per the AICPA's news release:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>The AICPA developed the valuation standard to improve the consistency and quality of practice among its members who perform engagements that estimate values for various reasons .&#160;.&#160;. Congress, government agencies, and accounting regulators have recently focused their attention on appraisal issues&#8212;such activity shows the importance of valuation to the business community and individuals. In addition, an increasing number of CPAs offer valuation services. The standard promotes greater transparency and provides our members with a set of guidelines in the unique context of a CPA practice.</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/stk_1a_8.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Unlike the situation in <i>Berg</i>, CPAs now have guidelines to use when performing a business valuation from the time of the acceptance of the engagement, the gathering of data, the development of a value, and finally, the writing of the report. By following the standards set in this statement, the valuation analyst will gain credibility in the legal setting and the business community at large. The <i>Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i> (SSVS No. 1) is effective for all business valuations accepted on or after January 1, 2008, that are prepared by members of the AICPA. The statement can be downloaded as a PDF file from the AICPA's website. Any CPA involved with valuation engagements needs to be familiar with the contents of SSVS No. 1 and follow the steps outlined in the statement.</p>
<p>In addition, both the AICPA and NACVA (National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts) have developed rigorous certification programs with continuing education requirements for CPAs preparing business valuations. These programs include written, proctored examinations, and involvement with business valuations under the tutelage of a qualified individual before certification is granted. These programs have allowed certified individuals to support their claims that they are &#8220;experts&#8221; in business valuation.</p>
<br/><p>As with any type of consulting engagement, a CPA accepting a valuation engagement needs to have the following:</p>
<table style="margin-top:22.5px;">
<tr><td>
<img style="margin-top:14px;" src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
</td>
<td><p>They must have <i>Professional Competence</i> and accept only engagements that the individual (or firm) can expect to complete with the required specialized proficiency. A business valuation certification as well as the required CPE necessary to retain those certifications provides a CPA with the basis for the necessary competency.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img style="margin-top:14px;" src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
</td>
<td><p>They must perform all business valuations with <i>Due Professional Care</i>. SSVS No. 1 provides an outline of the steps necessary when executing a business valuation.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img style="margin-top:14px;" src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
</td>
<td><p>They must <i>Plan and Supervise</i> the business valuation in an adequate fashion. Again, SSVS No. 1 provides a guideline to help accomplish these goals.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img style="margin-top:14px;" src="common/custom-images/gavel_on.gif" alt="gavel image"/>
</td>
<td><p>They must obtain <i>Sufficient Relevant Data</i> to support the determination of value. SSVS No. 1 clearly spells out the type of information that is necessary to support a calculated or conclusion of value.</p>

<p>The following are some examples of business value definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Net book value</b>: The difference between assets (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization) and liabilities as they appear on the balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Liquidation value</b>: The net amount that is expected to be received from the sale of an organization's assets and the settlement of its debts. Liquidation can be conducted in either a forced or orderly fashion resulting in different ultimate values.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Investment value</b>: The value that a particular investor places on a business, taking into consideration projected income, projected cash flow, and risk. In other words, the analyst is concerned about the real value of the asset that can be determined only with a higher level of knowledge than the typical investor about the item being valued. For example, the real value of an asset may be different than the price exchanged between a willing buyer and a willing seller since the focus is on a particular investor.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Intrinsic value</b>: The value that is placed on a business, taking into consideration projected income, projected cash flow, and risk as interpreted by an analyst. In other words, the analyst is concerned about the real value of the asset that can be determined only with a higher level of knowledge than held by the typical investor about the item being valued. For example, the real value of an asset may be different than the current market value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Market value</b>: A type of value, stated as an opinion, that presumes the transfer of property (i.e., a right of ownership or a bundle of such rights), as of a certain date, under specific conditions set forth in the definition of the term identified by the appraiser as applicable in an appraisal. (USPAP 2016-2017 Edition, Definitions, p.3, Lines 92-94)</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Going concern value</b>: The value of a business enterprise that is expected to continue to operate into the future. The value created in a company as the result of intangibles, such as an expert workforce or a loyal, established customer base, are part of the going concern value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Fair market value</b>: The amount for which a business would exchange hands given a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable about the relevant facts of the transaction, are under no compulsion to enter into the transaction, and have no special relationship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p><hr style="width:25%;"/><br/>
<br/><h3>Fair Market Value</h3>
<p>Fair market value is a concept that is used by courts and the IRS to settle disputed estate- and gift-tax issues. However, this concept is seldom used by a willing seller and a willing buyer. Transactions between third parties generally involve a negotiation process. As such, <i>value</i> is defined by what the seller is willing to accept and the buyer is willing to pay. For a business with above-average earnings for its industry, a buyer is often willing to pay a premium over the potential selling price of an average firm. If adverse economic conditions exist, a seller may be forced to accept a discounted sales price. Since many business valuations are prepared for purposes other than the actual sale to a third party, the concept of fair market value as defined by the courts and the IRS is extremely important.</p>
<p>For estate-tax purposes (Reg. &#167;20.2031-1(b)) and for gift-tax purposes (Reg. &#167;25.2512-1), fair market value is defined as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Key Term</h2>
<p>The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, both parties having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. (Reg. &#167;20.2031-1(b)) Court decisions often assert that these hypothetical parties are able, as well as willing, to trade, and are <i>well-informed</i> about the property and the market for such property.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<p>In other words, both the buyer and the seller have informed knowledge about the particular business being valued, the industry, the national and regional economy, and any other pertinent facts related to the company and the environment in which it operates.</p>
<br/><h3>Elements of Fair Market Value</h3>
<p>Looking closely at the definition of fair market value, the important elements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There must be two unrelated parties involved&#8212;a hypothetical willing buyer and a hypothetical willing seller. Neither party is under any compulsion to buy or sell. Both are free to walk away from any negotiated deal that is not satisfactory to them. Note that the seller and buyer are &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; and not specific, and the characteristics of this hypothetical buyer or seller are not necessarily the same as the characteristics of an actual buyer or seller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both parties must have reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. Both parties are aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the business in question. They are also knowledgeable about the industry and the economy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These facts are used to predict a future which is neither unreasonably pessimistic nor unreasonably optimistic. Fair market value is agreeable to both sides, given that both parties want to make the best deal possible. In other words, the fair market value is the most probable selling price, as opposed to the highest or lowest negotiated price.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is the price upon which the intelligent and reasonable buyer and seller would agree. Neither party has an advantage over the other in knowledge, understanding of the issues, or legal or technical resources. In other words, a level playing field exists.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is determined for a specific valuation date, and the hypothetical seller and buyer do not have knowledge about unforeseeable future events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fair market value is considered to be the highest and best use of the property and not necessarily the value related to how the property is currently used. For example, land currently may be used for farming. The best use of the property, however, may be for a large retail establishment. In such a case, the land should be valued for use as a retail establishment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>Fair Value</h3>
<p>Another important definition of value is Fair Value. Per FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 (ASC 820), fair value is</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>.&#160;.&#160;.the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. (FASB ASC 820-10-20)</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<p>When determining fair value, it is assumed that the value measurement is being made for a particular asset, liability, or equity ownership given its specific attributes, age and condition, location, possible restrictions on sale, and ability to stand alone or need to function as a group.</p>
<br/><p><b>To view this interactivity please view chapter 1, page 18</b></p><p><b>Interactivity information:</b><br/>
<p>The three important components included in the definition of fair value that are important to understand are:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p><b>Price:</b> The hypothetical transaction is assumed to have occurred in an orderly fashion. In other words, the holder of the asset or liability is able to take advantage of normal market activities for the transaction in question. The item being valued is considered to be exposed to the market for an appropriate amount of time prior to the measurement date. Furthermore, this is not a sale made under conditions of forced liquidation or distress.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p><b>Principal market:</b> It is assumed that the hypothetical transaction occurred in either the principal market for such a transaction, or in the absence of such a market, the most advantageous market. <i>Principal market</i> is defined as the market where the holder of the asset or liability could find the greatest volume of asset sales or liability transfers similar to the item in question. <i>Most advantageous market</i> is the one where the price received for the asset sale is maximized, or the transfer cost of the liability is minimized.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p><b>Market participants:</b> The market participants are the seller (holder of the asset or liability being valued) and the buyer in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. It is assumed that the seller and buyer are independent, knowledgeable, and have both the ability and willingness to complete the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ol></p><hr style="width:25%;"/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/stk_1b_19.jpg"/><br/>
<p>So what definition of value should be used in a business valuation engagement? The answer to that is quite simple &#8211; That depends! There are no one-size-fits all situations in the field of business valuation. Different value definitions should potentially be used for different business valuations&#8212;depending upon the circumstances related to the particular engagement. In fact, one of the items that must be clearly defined in a business valuation report is the standard of value that is used. The definition of value, purpose of the valuation, and type of ownership interest will affect the selection of valuation methods. For example, in a divorce engagement, a company will be valued based upon relevant statues and case law for the particular state where the divorce is being litigated&#8212;it is not unusual for the courts to require a particular definition of value for a particular case. Thus, the definition of value used is especially critical to the valuation process. The standard of value is:</p>

</table><br/><h1 style="margin-top:27px;" >1 C. Reasons to Value Closely Held Businesses</h1>
<h2>The Valuation Process</h2>
<p>Valuation of a closely held business is the process by which a monetary value is established for an entire or partial interest in that business. The use of quantitative and qualitative factors determine the values of both tangible assets (such as receivables, inventory, and fixed assets) and intangible assets (such as patents and goodwill), which are then used to determine the worth of the company.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, SSVS No. 1 is a set of standards for CPAs to follow who are active in various business valuation engagements of both for profit and not-for-profit organizations. The existence of these standards does not preclude the necessity of the CPA to meet requirements set forth by any governmental or court regulations, or other professional standards such as the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. A critical item in the conduct code related to business valuation engagements is that the valuation analyst should not undertake any engagement for which the individual does not possess the requisite professional competence (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (2007), <i>Statement of Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i>, &#182; 11).</p>
<p>The analyst should possess:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An understanding of valuation principles and theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>The skill necessary to apply the theoretical knowledge of business valuation topics</p>
</li>
<li><p>The professional judgment necessary to develop a conclusion or calculation of value as defined in SSVS No. 1</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As in other areas of accounting practices, a CPA needs to continually refine the skills necessary to competently complete a particular engagement.</p>
<br/><h3>Objectivity and conflict of interest</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img2.jpg"/><br/>
<p>The AICPA&#39;s <b>Code of Professional Conduct</b> requires CPAs to be objective when performing professional services. A CPA is expected to be impartial and free of conflicts of interest. SSVS No. 1 states that the CPA performing valuation services is expected to follow the AICPA's <b>Code of Professional Conduct</b> regarding objectivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>A member in public practice or his or her firm may be faced with a conflict of interest when performing a professional service. In determining whether a professional service, relationship or matter would result in a conflict of interest, a member should use professional judgment, taking into account whether a reasonable and informed third party who is aware of the relevant information would conclude that a conflict of interest exists.</p>
<p>A conflict of interest creates adverse interest and self-interest threats to the member&#39;s compliance with the Integrity and Objectivity rule. For example, threats may be created when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the member or the member&#39;s firm provides a professional service related to a particular matter involving two or more clients whose interests with respect to that matter are in conflict; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>the interests of the member or the member&#39;s firm with respect to a particular matter and the interests of the client for whom the member or the member&#39;s firm provides a professional service related to that matter are in conflict.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<br/><h3>Independence</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img3.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Independence has been a sensitive topic in recent years, and it is not unusual for the CPA's independence related to attest activities to be questioned if they accept a business valuation engagement from a client.</p>
<p>(SSVS No. 1, &#182;15)</p>
<p>Threats to compliance with the &#8220;Independence Rule&#8221; [1.200.001] would not be at an acceptable level and could not be reduced to an acceptable level by the application of <i>safeguards</i> if the member performs an appraisal, a valuation, or an actuarial service for an attest client when:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(a)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>the services involve a significant degree of subjectivity, and</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(b)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>the results of the service, individually or when combined with other valuation, appraisal, or actuarial services, are material to the attest client's financial statements. Accordingly, independence would be impaired under these circumstances.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/><p>Independence would be impaired if a member performs an appraisal, valuation, or actuarial service for an attest client where the results of the service, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to the financial statements and the appraisal, valuation, or actuarial service involves a significant degree of subjectivity.</p>
<p>(American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Code of Professional Conduct, ET Section 1.295.110.02 &#8211; Independence, Nonattest Services, Appraisal, Valuation and Actuarial Services)</p>
<p>Examples of valuations that generally involve a significant degree of subjectivity include, ESOPs, business combinations, or appraisals of assets or liabilities. Accordingly, if these services produce results that are material to the attest client's financial statements, independence would be impaired. Valuations performed in connection with, for example, employee stock ownership plans, business combinations, or appraisals of assets or liabilities generally involve a significant degree of subjectivity. Accordingly, if these services produce results that are material to the financial statements, independence would be impaired.</p>
<p>(American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (April 30, 2014), Code of Professional Conduct, ET Section 101 1.295.110.04 &#8211; Independence, .05 101-3 Nonattest Services, Appraisal, Valuation and Actuarial Services)</p>
<br/><h3>The purpose of the valuation</h3>
<p>The first step in a business valuation is to determine the purpose of the valuation. Different purposes for the valuation will often necessitate the use of different valuation methods that will result in different values.</p>
<p>Why does this occur? There are different state and federal statutes and regulations, and these different conventions affect the approach taken to valuations. For example, divorce law is guided by state statute, and the standards of value used by the states can vary. The most common choices are fair market value, intrinsic value, and investment value. Remember, fair market value assumes that there is a hypothetical (not specific) buyer and a hypothetical seller, both with reasonable knowledge of the business situation. Intrinsic value assumes that the parties involved have a greater understanding of the business situation than the typical investor. Investment value is based on the standard of value for a specific investor. Obviously, these three valuation approaches would likely lead to different determinations of value.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Valuation date</h3>
<p>The valuation date can also lead to different business values. Again, looking at the divorce situation, the valuation date used in a divorce proceeding could be the date of the marriage, the date of the separation, the date of the filing, or the date of the trial. Since there can be years between the date of the marriage and the date of the trial, the determination of value can differ as a result of the valuation date chosen.</p>
<br/><h3>Identification of assets</h3>
<p>It is not unusual for an important marital asset to be a closely held business. As a general rule, at the dissolution of a marriage, a small, family run business is not divided between the spouses. One spouse will receive the business in the distribution of marital assets, and the other spouse will receive other assets of equal value. Obviously, a value for the business in question must be obtained and agreed upon by the two parties before the distribution of the assets can take place.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Caution</h2>
<p>Because divorce is covered by state laws, it is important for the individual preparing the business valuation to be aware of the definition of the standard of value in the state where the valuation is prepared. For example, goodwill and the inclusion of a covenant not to compete will be included in the definition of value for a closely held business in some states, not in others.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<h3>Estate planning</h3>
<p>The IRS will require a valuation of a nonpublicly traded business upon the death of the owner(s), for estate-tax purposes. As a practitioner, it is wise to suggest to clients who own such businesses that they obtain periodic valuations so that planning can be done to minimize the ultimate estate tax. The IRS is also more likely to accept the estate valuation when it has been done on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As part of estate planning, it is not unusual for business ownership to be passed on to the younger generations during the owner's lifetime. The IRS will require a proper valuation of such a gift. In the same light, charitable contributions of ownership in a closely held business need documentation to support the value of that donation.</p>
<br/><h2>Guidance</h2>
<p>Due to a large body of statutory law, IRS regulations, and long-standing case law, there is a great deal of direction provided to a business valuator when dealing with a business valuation that will be governed by federal tax laws (including employee stock ownership plans). The IRS leans towards the use of comparables (a market approach) and the use of fair market value as the standard of value. The business valuator can refer to Revenue Ruling 59-60 when preparing a tax-related business valuation for guidance as to what valuation approach to employ. As stated in Section 3.03 of Revenue Ruling 59-60:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>Valuation of securities is, in essence, a prophecy as to the future and must be based on facts available at the required date of appraisal. As a generalization, the prices of stocks which are traded in volume in a free and active market by informed persons best reflect the consensus of the investing public as to what the future holds for the corporations and industries represented. When a stock is closely held, is traded infrequently, or is traded in an erratic market, some other measure of value must be used. In many instances, the next best measure may be found in the prices at which the stocks of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business are selling in a free and open market.</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;3.03</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<br/><h2>Tax-Related Valuations</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_1c_29.jpg"/><br/>
<p>It is important to remember that tax-related valuations (estate and gift taxes) use the definition of fair market value that sets price at a level &#8220;at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell&#8221; (Revenue Ruling 59-60 , &#167;2.02). The valuations done for tax purposes also tend not to focus on future earnings since such returns are considered difficult to predict and speculative in nature. Thus, the focus is on the use of comparables.</p>
<br/><h2>Nontax Valuations</h2>
<h3>Sales of Businesses</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg19_290.jpg"/><br/>
<p>There are also non-tax purposes for preparing a business valuation. The potential purchaser of a closely held business may wish to have a formal valuation prepared as a guide in determining the maximum offer that he will be willing to make. This potential purchaser will have a set of investment criteria that includes the investment value of the purchase. This is the value that an investor places on a business, taking into consideration projected income, projected cash flow, and risk.</p>
<p>The value of the investment is based upon the risk of holding the investment and the expected earnings due to potential synergies inherent in the investment. For example, the purchase of a distribution center could provide a great deal of synergy for a manufacturer of machine parts. Also, in a buy/sell situation, the seller could possess a higher level of knowledge about the closely held business than the typical investor, resulting in the use of intrinsic value as the valuation method.</p>
<p>On the other side, the seller may wish to have a formal valuation prepared as a guide in determining the minimum offer that she will be willing to accept. The seller may also approach the valuation process through the use of intrinsic and/or investment value as well as fair market value-what buyers are willing to pay. Business transactions occur within a larger framework guided by market conditions. For example, if there are numerous medical practices for sale in an area at a given time, it would be considered a &#8220;buyer's market&#8221; since, if a seller is motivated for personal reasons to sell quickly, that individual would be willing to accept a lower amount for the sale of a business. On the flip side, if a &#8220;seller's market&#8221; exists, buyers are often willing to pay the seller's intrinsic value.</p>
<br/><h3>Mergers</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cla_pg20_320.jpg"/><br/>
<p>A business valuation may play an important part in determining stock exchange rates in the merger of a closely held company with a publicly traded organization. A merger is the combination of two separate companies through the exchange of stock and/or cash for stock or assets of the other. This type of business transaction would require valuation of both entities to determine a proper exchange rate for stock.</p>
<p>The majority shareholders of a closely held company may wish to buy out the minority shareholders, and a fair business valuation could be instrumental in determining the buyout price. All states have laws that provide recourse for minority stockholders if they feel that the compensation offered in a merger or buy-out is insufficient. Fair value generally is used in the business valuation required to resolve such a conflict.</p>
<p>Remember that <i>fair value</i> and <i>fair market value</i> are not one in the same. It is wise for the business valuator to be familiar with state statues and case law before attempting such a valuation assignment.</p>
<br/><h3>Lending</h3>
<p>Banks are often reluctant to lend funds to closely held businesses. A business valuation can determine the value of assets to be used as collateral. GAAP financial statements reflect the historical, depreciated cost of the business assets, which could be dramatically different than the fair market value of those assets. A valuation may also illustrate how the company can be expected to use those assets to generate future earnings and help convince the lender that enough cash will be generated to repay the potential loan.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Look at the following GAAP balance sheet for Dunbar Company:</p>
<div style="margin-top:22.5px;">

<p>The local bank is reluctant to lend money to Dunbar for expansion based upon the balance sheet. Using an asset-based approach where the assets are restated using fair market value, it was determined that the long-term assets were actually worth $180,000. This was due to the fact that the plant and equipment had a higher fair market value than the depreciated historical value as stated on the financial statements. Thus, using fair market value, the balance sheet could be restated as:</p>

<p>A banker may be less reluctant to provide an expansion loan for a company with a lower debt to equity ratio based upon the normalized financial statements.</p>
<br/><h3>More reasons</h3>
<p>There are other reasons for valuing a closely held business:</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Initial public offerings</h3>
<p>A company's stock needs to be valued prior to an initial public offering. These companies often are small organizations that were developed around a particular product or service and are expected to experience rapid growth. Outside funding (through a public stock offering) is often necessary to support that growth.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)</h3>
<p>An ESOP's stock has to be valued annually since the stock of the nonpublic company is used as additional compensation for employees. Since ESOPs come under federal regulation, the concept of fair market value is used when determining value.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Damage determination</h3>
<p>Damage cases that relate to patent infringements, breaches of contract, wrongful death action, etc., often require a business valuation in order to determine the actual damages suffered. The definition of value can vary among different damage categories and jurisdictions. The business valuator should study the legal precedents that apply to the valuation in question.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Spin-offs</h3>
<p>Sometimes a partial valuation is prepared if a segment of a closely held business is spun off.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<p>In valuing a going concern, future income may be a factor. In valuing a business that is liquidating, the value of the net assets would be the focus of the valuation due to the lack of potential future income flows. If the valuation is for estate or gift-tax purposes, the courts generally prefer verifiable facts to projections. Such facts would include the fair market value of the assets involved and past income.</p>
<p>An individual purchasing a closely held business would be interested in the value of the <i>intended</i> use of the assets, which might not necessarily be their <i>current</i> use.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>If a buyer was purchasing a dry cleaning business on a corner lot that he intended to continue operating, he would be concerned about the future value that could be created. He would be purchasing a going concern and would be most interested in the potential future income of the establishment.</p>
<p>If the buyer was purchasing this same business in order to obtain the land so that a parking ramp could be constructed after razing the current facility, he would be concerned about the future value that could be created by the proposed parking lot. In this case, the purchaser would be concerned about the liquidation value of the assets to be sold and the fair market value of the land.</p>

<br/><h2>Choosing a Valuation Method</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg27_450.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Valuations need to be prepared using a method that will be compatible with the value being determined. When choosing a method, the valuation analyst needs to ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is liquidation going to occur? As future earnings would not be important in such a case, the liquidation value of the assets would be more appropriate to use than fair market value or replacement value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is this organization a going concern? In this case, earnings could play an important role in the valuation since it is assumed that the business will continue to operate well into the future. How the company will use its operating assets becomes an important issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the opportunity costs for the use of this business? Are there alternative uses for the facility? What is the best use of the business assets?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the legal requirements for this valuation? Especially in estate- and gift-tax situations, the IRS regulations involving valuation are important. Remember, the IRS and courts tend to favor a valuation based on historical facts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/cl_pg28_470.jpg"/><br/>
<p>The choice of the appropriate valuation method will be based on the circumstances of the particular case. There are a number of different approaches available to the valuator, and the four most common are as follows:</p>

<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Market approach</h3>
<p>A market approach seeks market comparisons in order to determine the value of a closely held business. This valuation method is preferred by the IRS and courts, so a search for comparables should be performed. However, it can be difficult&#8212;and often impossible&#8212;to find useful guideline companies or comparables.</p>
<p>The use of guideline companies when valuing a closely held business will be discussed in more detail later in the course. Please note that &#8220;comparable&#8221; and &#8220;guideline&#8221; are considered to be similar terms; however, the term &#8220;guideline&#8221; has become the preferred name in recent years.</p>
<br/><h3>Asset-based approach</h3>
<p>The most common asset-based approach is the <i>adjusted net assets method,</i> also known as both the <i>net asset value method</i> and the <i>adjusted book value method.</i> The basis of this method is to calculate the value of the business by deducting the fair market value of the company's liabilities from the fair market value of the assets. In other words, the equity of the firm is based upon the fair market value&#8212;as opposed to the book value&#8212;of the assets and liabilities</p>
<p>An asset-based approach is an excellent example of what is known as the &#8220;economic substitution principle.&#8221; It states that no one would be willing to pay more for an asset than the price to obtain a substitute.</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/example.gif" alt="Example image"/>
<br/>
<p>Assume that you wish to purchase laminating equipment to start a business out of your home, and you are convinced that you can sell everything that you produce. All else being equal, you will not be willing to pay supplier A more for the inputs than supplier B is willing to accept for the same materials.</p>
<p>Similarly, you will not be willing to pay more than the fair market value for a business provided that another business is available at a similar price, and that the second business has similar assets and equal risk and is a reasonable substitute for the first.</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<br/><p>When using the adjusted net assets method for valuing land and a factory building, the land is valued separately from the improvements. The land should be valued at its highest and best use.</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/example.gif" alt="Example image"/>
<br/>
<p>If you were to value a small restaurant located on two lots in the middle of a crowded office district, the highest and best use of the land may be for a parking ramp. It is for this use that the land valuation will be based.</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<p>When valuing the improvements, the valuation needs to take into consideration allowances for functional obsolescence, physical deterioration, and economic or external obsolescence. The total value for the real estate being valued would be the sum of the fair market value of the land and the improvements. The use of a professional real estate appraiser probably will be necessary to help in the determination of the fair market value. In fact, business valuations often require a team approach since the individual preparing the valuation often is not an expert in establishing land, building, and/or equipment values. SSVS No. 1 provides guidelines for the CPA when enlisting the services of other professionals such as real estate appraisers or equipment appraisers in the course of a business valuation.</p>
<br/><p>Per SSVS No. 1:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>In performing an engagement to estimate value, the valuation analyst may rely on the work of a third party specialist (for example, a real estate or equipment appraiser). The valuation analyst should note in the assumptions and limiting conditions the level of responsibility, if any, being assumed by the valuation analyst for the work of the third party specialist. At the option of the valuation analyst, the written report of the third-party specialist may be included in the valuation analyst's report.</p>
<p>American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, <i>Statement of Standards for Valuation Services No. 1</i> , &#182; 20</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<p>The adjusted net assets method provides a floor value for valuing a company, since an owner will seldom accept less than the net asset value for a business. An acceptable value could be lower than the fair market value for the entire company, such as replacement value for an insurance claim, but never less than the liquidation value. The owner could liquidate the firm's assets instead of selling the entire business if liquidation would be more profitable. Again, the substitution principle comes into play. Although most sellers hope to receive more than the adjusted net assets value due to the existence of goodwill, the adjusted net assets method can provide a reality check for other valuation methods. <b><i>No business valuation should establish a value below liquidation value for the assets involved.</i></b></p>
<br/><h3>When is it Appropriate to use an Asset-Based Approach?</h3>
<p>The asset-based approach is an excellent method to use for:</p>
<table style="margin-top:22.5px;">

</td></tr></table>
<br/><p>A general rule is that the subject company represents its &#8220;value&#8221; in tangible assets&#8212;or intangible assets such as patents or copyrights&#8212;that can easily be assigned a market, replacement, or liquidation value. It is also important that the individual(s) holding the controlling interest has the ability to liquidate the assets of the organization. This means that if the valuation is being done for a minority interest, an asset-based approach would not be suitable since the minority shareholder would not have the ability to force a sale of the company's assets. An asset-based approach would not be suitable to use for a service company, or one that has few assets.</p>
<p>Revenue Ruling 59-60 states that the asset-based valuation approach may best be applied when the company in question has significant nonoperating assets in the form of investments, such as real estate. Revenue Ruling 59-60 further states the following:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>In general, the appraiser will accord primary consideration to earnings when valuing stocks of companies which sell products or services to the public; conversely, in the investment or holding type company, the appraiser may accord the greatest weight to the assets underlying the security to be valued.</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;5(a)</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<br/><h3>Income approach</h3>
<p>Many investors are not satisfied with only a two- or three-percent return on invested funds. These investors may wish to purchase stock in a publicly traded organization. Because an investment in stock is riskier than a certificate of deposit, investors will require a higher rate of return to compensate for the risk of the stock investment.</p>
<p>The income-oriented approaches to business valuation are based on the theory that an investor will require an investment to yield a return sufficient to recover the initial cost of the investment, as well as provide a return sufficient to compensate for the perceived risk of that investment. In other words, the higher the perceived risk, the higher the expected return required to attract potential investors. This return comes in the form of future earnings. It is reasonable to assume that the actual or expected earnings and/or cash flows of a closely held business are critical components when determining a value for such an organization</p>
<p>Because future net cash inflows are used to determine a value for the subject organization when using an income-oriented approach to business valuation, it is important that the company be a going concern that is expected to have a positive future income-producing capacity. This method incorporates the theory of discounted cash flows.</p>
<p>Future net cash inflows are projected, and then those net cash inflows are discounted to a present value using an appropriate discount rate reflecting the degree of risk involved in the investment proposal. These income based approaches require a thorough analysis of revenues, costs, capital assets, capital structure, the industry, the national and/or international economy, and the region in which the company operates in order to develop a realistic forecast of future net cash inflows. The analyst is also required to choose appropriate capitalization and/or discount rates to reflect the risk of the investment.</p>

<h3>Excess-income approach</h3>
<p><i>The excess earnings (Treasury) method</i> is one of the most common approaches used in the valuation of closely held businesses. It is also an approach that is frequently misapplied. This method is actually a combination of an asset-based approach and an income approach. The excess earnings method separates the income stream into two distinct parts:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The normal income created by the net tangible assets of the company</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>The excess income created by the intangible assets of the company</p>
</li>
</ol></p><hr style="width:25%;"/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/stk_1d_51.jpg"/><br/>
<p>The value of the company is then determined by adding the adjusted book value of the net tangible assets to the capitalized value of the excess earnings. It could be said that this approach arrives at a value for a business by combining the value of the net tangible assets and the intangible assets,</p>
<p>The excess earnings method acquired its name from the IRS in <i>Appeals and Review Memorandum Number 34</i> (ARM 34) and Revenue Ruling 68-609. This method combines the income and asset-based approaches since both the fair market value of the assets and excess earnings are used in preparing a valuation for a closely held business.</p>
<p>The theoretical premise for this method is that the total value of a firm is the sum of the values of the adjusted net assets as determined using the adjusted net assets method, and the value of the intangible assets. The value of the intangible assets is determined by capitalizing the business earnings that exceed a reasonable rate of return for the adjusted net assets of the business. A reasonable rate of return is often defined as the rate that is average for the industry.</p>
<br/><p>This method first appeared in ARM 34, which was published in 1920 by the U.S. Treasury Department (thus the name &#8220;Treasury Method&#8221;). This method was devised to estimate the intangible value of goodwill that breweries and distilleries lost because of Prohibition. This method has been widely used to estimate the value of businesses for gift tax, estate tax, and other taxation purposes. It is often used for valuing businesses and professional practices in divorce cases.</p>
<p>The valuation method set out by the IRS in ARM 34 uses a formula approach. The theory behind this method is that the company's net tangible assets could be expected to earn a &#8220;normal profit&#8221; that was defined as an 8- to 10-percent return on those assets. Any profit above that normal return would be due to the fact that the business had intangible assets (goodwill).</p>
<p>The IRS suggested that those intangible assets could result in a 15- to 20-percent return. Although ARM 34 was originally developed for use with breweries and distilleries, this method has been used for companies in many types of industries. Over time, however, it has been determined that the rates as indicated in this memorandum are not appropriate for <i>all</i> companies, in <i>all</i> industries, in <i>all</i> situations. In fact, the IRS has become disenchanted with its own valuation method, and Revenue Ruling 68-609 was issued in an attempt to curb misinterpretations of the Treasury method.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>The [excess earning] approach may be used for determining the fair market value of intangible assets of a business only if there is no better basis therefore available.</p>
<p>Rev. Rul. 68-609, 1968-2 C.B. 327 IRC Sec. 1001</p>

<p>This valuation method was restated in 1968 in Revenue Ruling 68-609, which is still in effect today. This method was originally created for the purpose of valuing intangible assets, but it has often been used to value a company as a whole. Prior to ARM 34, businesses were generally sold at the value of the tangible assets, since intangible assets were not deemed to have value. Two key perceptions emerged from ARM 34.</p>

<p>ARM 34 states that <i>excess earnings</i> are the company's earnings that are in excess of the earnings above the average for companies in the industry with similar size and activities. Obviously, a study of companies in the industry is necessary when using this method</p>

<h1 style="margin-top:27px;" >2 A. Use of Guidelines for Valuation</h1>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg2_740.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Recall the previous discussion of the provisions of Revenue Ruling 59-60 and Regulation Sections 20.2031-1(b) and 25.2512-1, which provided, respectively, a definition of a closely held business and of the concept of fair market value for the purposes of valuing a closely held business. These sources suggested that when dealing with the valuation of a closely held firm for estate- and gift-tax purposes, the IRS and the courts prefer that the valuation be based on historical facts rather than projections. In this context, it is desirable that the valuation be based on the use of guideline companies (formerly known as comparables).</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will deal with the key issues associated with finding and using guideline companies in the valuation process as well as discuss the basic analytical issues involved in a business valuation when using a market method.</p>
<br/><h3>What is a Guideline Company?</h3>
<p>A comparable company has been defined as one which has <i>reasonable</i> and <i>justifiable</i> similarity to the closely held business that is being valued. The issue of reasonable similarity has been addressed in two cases. <i>Tallichet v. Commissioner,</i> T.C. Memo 1974-255 (1974), indicated that there are &#8220;guideposts in determining comparability.&#8221; <i>Estate of Victor B. Clarke, T.C. Memo 1976-328 (1976),</i> stated &#8220;it is imperative that the characteristics of the subject company and the purported comparable company relevant to the question of value be isolated and examined so that significant comparison can be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>These cases take into account factors such as:</p>
<table style="margin-top:22.5px;">

<p>Justifiable similarity means that the valuator could defend his/her choice of guidelines to other informed individuals.</p>
<br/><p>In Revenue Ruling 59-60, it is stated:</p>
<br/>

<blockquote>

<p>.&#160;.&#160;.that in valuing unlisted securities the value of stock or securities of corporations engaged in the same or a similar line of business which are listed on an exchange should be taken into consideration along with all other factors.&#160;.&#160;. Although the only restrictive requirement as to comparable corporations specified in the statute is that their lines of business be the same or similar, yet it is obvious that consideration must be given to other relevant factors in order that the most valid comparison possible will be obtained.</p>

<br/><p>Thus, while the statute requires that firms simply be in a similar line of business to be considered a guideline company, the IRS indicates that this &#8220;similarity&#8221; must extend to other factors as well.</p>
<p>There are two basic approaches for using guideline companies.</p>

<p>It is important to understand what these vital relevant factors are when approaching a business valuation. Section 4.01 of Revenue Ruling 59-60 states:</p>
<p>It is advisable to emphasize that in the valuation of the stock of closely held corporations or the stock of corporations where market quotations are either lacking or too scarce to be recognized, all available financial data, as well as all relevant factors affecting the fair market value, should be considered. The following factors, although not all-inclusive, are fundamental and require careful analysis in each case:</p>

<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
<li value="1"><p>The nature of the business and the history of the enterprise from its inception</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>The economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook of the specific industry in particular</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>The book value of the stock and the financial condition of the business</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>The earning capacity of the company</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>The dividend-paying capacity</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Whether or not the enterprise has goodwill or other intangible value</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Sales of the stock and the size of the block of stock to be valued</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>The market price of stocks of corporations engaged in the same or a similar line of business having their stocks actively traded in a free and open market, either on an exchange or over-the-counter</p>
</li>

<br/><h3>Nature of the Business</h3>
<p>It is important to understand the historic performance of the subject company. Has the company shown stable or unstable performance in the past? Has the asset base or the reported profit increased or decreased in the years that comprise the data set? Does the organization provide a diverse set of products or services, or does it lack diversity? As stated in Revenue Ruling 59-60:</p>
<blockquote>

<img src="common/images/quote.gif" alt="Quote image"/>
<br/>
<p>The history to be studied should include, but need not be limited to, the nature of the business, its products or services, its operating and investment assets, capital structure, plant facilities, sales records and management, all of which should be considered as of the date of the appraisal, with due regard for recent significant changes. Events of the past that are unlikely to recur in the future should be discounted, since value has a close relation to future expectancy. Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.02(a)</p>

<br/>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<p>This historical review of the subject organization will aid the valuator in gaining a thorough understanding of the subject company.</p>
<br/><h3>Economic Outlook</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_2a_8.jpg"/><br/>
<p>The regional, national, and international economic outlook in respect to the subject company must be considered. Since the significance of specific economic factors can vary greatly from one industry to another, it is important to have a firm understanding of how various economic indicators may affect the growth prospects of the industry as well as of the subject company. For example, a decrease in housing starts would likely decrease the sales trend for a real estate developer involved in building subdivisions in a suburban area.</p>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg6_785.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Other national economic data that could have a close relationship to business trends in an industry could include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gross national product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gross domestic product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consumer price index</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disposable personal income</p>
</li>
<li><p>Durable goods expenditures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unemployment rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interest rates/monetary policy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all economic indicators will affect all companies. Through discussions with the business owner(s) and a study of the industry of which the company is a part, the valuator can generally determine which economic indicators might provide a potential cause and effect relationship regarding sales and/or growth of the subject company.</p>
<p>Regional economic issues are also factors. For example, when valuing an optical shop in a small community, it would be important to know that the largest employer in the area was closing its doors. In conjunction with regional issues, it is also important to be aware of how the subject company compares to the competition. Does the subject company command a large market share compared to competitors, or is it less able to compete in the current market?</p>
<p>Knowledge of the product is also important. If the business being valued produces a &#8220;fad&#8221; product and has no other products in the pipeline, insight into the lifecycle of that product would be important.</p>
<br/><h3>The Book Value of the Stock and the Financial Condition of the Business</h3>
<p>This is where the analyst goes to work. Revenue Ruling 59-60 &#167;4.02(c) states that two or more years of balance sheets immediately preceding the valuation date need to be acquired as well as a balance sheet of the month immediately preceding the given date. Using these statements, it is important to determine the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Liquidity position (using the current ratio)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Working capital (paying particular attention to the composition of the balance of current assets)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gross and net book value of principal classes of fixed assets (paying particular attention to age of the assets and change in fixed assets for the years in the data set)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Long-term indebtedness (paying particular attention to the timing of the future debt repayments)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Capital structure (paying particular attention to the balance of current debt, long-term debt, and equity used to finance operations and long-term acquisitions)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Net worth (paying particular attention to the ability to finance replacement/expansion through the use of equity, as well as dividend-paying ability)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><p>When examining the balance sheet, the business valuator needs to determine whether there are any non-operating assets listed. If so, such items should be removed from the balance sheet for the valuation of the basic operations, revalued at market value, and added back to the estimated value determined for the operations of the company.</p>
<p>If there is more than one class of stock, it is important for the business valuator to determine:</p>
<table style="margin-top:22.5px;">

<h3>The Earning Capacity of the Company</h3>
<p>Revenue Ruling 59-60 states that detailed, representative income statements for a period of preferably five or more years immediately preceding the valuation date need to be acquired. It is important to review the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Gross revenue by principle items:</b> This is important so that the business valuator can determine the lifecycle and potential of the products or services sold by the organization. Principle expenses include operating expenses, interest expense, depreciation, officer's salaries, contributions, taxes, and non-operating costs. It is important that the valuator determine whether these categories are reasonable and industry or region appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Net income and net income available for dividends:</b> Since value is closely tied to profitability, it is important to examine the profit capacity of the organization as well as determine whether the organization has the cash flow necessary to pay dividends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Rates and amounts of dividends paid on each class of stock:</b> This is perhaps one of the trickier areas of the valuation since many small companies try to avoid the double taxation of dividends by increasing officer's income and reducing dividends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Level of profits retained in the business:</b> It is important to determine whether the company is retaining enough of the profits in the organization to support growth without the need for external financing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.02(d-f)</p>
</p><hr style="width:25%;"/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg9_830.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Since it is often future benefits that are purchased when a business changes hands, it is important to look at the future earnings capacity for the subject company. Because conditions generally do not change quickly, the earnings of the past are often, by and large, a reliable guide to the profitability of the future.</p>
<p>Revenue Ruling 59-60 cautions not to resort to five- or ten-year averages without considering current trends. For example, if the sales of the main product produced by the subject company showed rapid growth in the first four years and for the next three years exhibited a leveling off of that growth, more weight should be put on the most recent years when determining the future earnings power of the organization. (Rev. Rul. 59-60, &#167;4.02(d))</p>
<br/><p>The focus of the analysis of the historic profitability of the subject company is on risk. Two important questions to ask would be:</p>
<table style="margin-top:22.5px;">
<tr><td>
<img style="margin-top:14px;" src="common/custom-images/question_on.gif" alt="question image"/>
</td>
<td><p>How has the company performed in the past?</p>

</td></tr><tr><td>
<img style="margin-top:14px;" src="common/custom-images/question_on.gif" alt="question image"/>
</td>
<td><p>Is that experience likely to continue in the future?</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>One of the analysis tools often introduced in a beginning managerial accounting course is that of the common sized statement. Such a review of the available income statements can provide a number of insights into the operations of the valued business. It is important to remember to remove any items from the historic data that are not likely to recur in the future before such a study is begun (normalization process).</p>
<br/><h3>The Dividend-Paying Capacity</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_2a_14.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Unlike publicly held companies, the dividend-paying capacity of a closely held organization may not be the same as the dividends actually paid. It is not unusual for a family held company to base dividend payments on the cash needs of the owners and/or their wish to avoid double taxation. Therefore, it is not a good practice to base the dividend-paying capacity on past practices when valuing a closely held company. The decision to pay dividends, increase salaries, or pay bonuses are at the discretion of the majority stockholder(s).</p>
<p>Care must be taken when reviewing the net income level and dividend payments. It is not unusual for a closely held organization to manipulate earnings and dividend levels to obtain desired results. For example, in order to avoid the double taxation of dividends, the majority owner of a small business can increase the officer's salary or bonus in order to keep the equity level at a specified debt to equity balance by not paying dividends.</p>
<br/><p>If the analyst plans to compare the earnings of a closely held business with those of a publicly held company, the earnings of the closely held business may have to be <i>normalized</i> for a useful comparison to be made. The earnings records of many closely held businesses often contain items that are not related to operations or operating assets, especially if the company is managed by the owners. It is not uncommon for a closely held business run as a sole proprietorship to have a mingling of business and personal expenses. The main objective of the normalizing adjustments is to more closely reflect the company's true economic position and results of operations. By normalizing the company's financial statements, a more accurate estimate of the fair market value of the business through the use of guidelines or projected earnings is possible.</p>
<p>Normalized financial statements should be useful for making comparisons, meaningful projections, and forecasts resulting in the determination of a reasonable market value for the subject company. The theory behind normalization adjustments is to restate the subject company's financial statements to better reflect economic reality, resulting in a more realistic estimate of the fair market value of the business.</p>
<p>Through the use of normalization adjustments, the valuator is better able to determine how the subject company:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>might have performed under normal conditions,</p>
</li>
<li><p>would realistically compare to a guideline organization, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>might be expected to perform in the future based on the performance of the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>The Determination of the Existence of Goodwill or Other Intangible Assets</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_image03.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Goodwill is the value above the fair value of the net assets that a buyer is willing to pay for the purchase of a company. It is thought to be created by the reputation of the organization and advantages that it has over the competition. The more profitable a company is in relation to what is considered to be a fair return on the operating assets, the greater the goodwill. The valuator must consider whether the reputation might be subject to a key man discount.</p>
<p>If business value could be calculated by using nothing more than the net liquidation value of the assets, business valuation would be easy and done by appraisers. However, it is the existence of intangible assets that makes business valuation more of an art than a science. Just what value does a trade name or brand name recognition have?</p>
<br/><h3>Sales of the Stock and the Size of the Block of Stock to be Valued</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg12_850.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Occasionally the stock of closely held corporations changes hands. It is important to determine whether such sales were arm's-length transactions, forced sales, or distressed sales. Non-arm's-length sales are not likely to be good representations of value. For example, if a minority stockholder is in need of cash, he or she is likely to be willing to sell his/her shares to another individual for an amount less than fair market value. A minority stockholder of a closely held organization might be willing to pay well over the fair market value for additional stock if that purchase would put him/her in a majority position.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >The Market Price of Stocks of Corporations Engaged in the Same or Similar Line of Business Having Their Stock Actively Traded in a Free and Open Market, Either on an Exchange or Over-the-Counter</h3>
<p>It is very clearly stated in Revenue Ruling 59-60 that, when valuing the stock of a closely held company, the sale of actively traded stock of publicly held organizations in the same industry should be taken into consideration. Not only should the possible guideline company be in the same line of business, the balance sheet structure of the two organizations should be similar. For example, if a closely held company has used bank debt and common equity as funding sources, it would not be comparable to a publicly traded organization that has used common stock, preferred stock, bank loans, and bond issues as funding sources. Therefore, it is important that the guideline company be similar in many ways to the subject organization, such as products or services produced, balance sheet structure, markets served, and recent growth experience rates. It is through the steps described in this section that the valuator gains enough information about the subject company in order to begin the search for guideline companies.</p>

</table><br/><h1 style="margin-top:27px;" >2 B. Beginning the Search for Guideline Companies</h1>
<h2>Finding a Guideline Company</h2>
<h3>North American Industry Classification System Codes</h3>
<p>A good starting point when searching for guideline companies is to determine the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the firm being valued. These codes are used by various Federal statistical agencies for the function of collecting, analyzing, and distributing statistical data related to numerous industries throughout North America. Replacing the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system in 1997, NAICS codes were developed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico so that there would be a significant degree of comparability in various business statistics within North America. The U.S. NAICS Manual can be extremely helpful in that it contains definitions of each industry as well as potentially valuable background information. The official U.S. Government website (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch) provides useful and current information related to the available NAICS references and tools.</p>
<br/><h3>Online Searches</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_2b_21.jpg"/><br/>
<p>A leading set of sources for finding potential guidelines would include online databases and searches of the industry. Websites and industry association publications provide a wealth of information that can be useful when conducting a search for such firms. Although some sources will supply little more than company names, it is possible&#8212;through additional searching or through the use of more sophisticated databases&#8212;to find information about potential guidelines, such as location, sales, solvency, and net income. It is often desirable to visit the website of a potential guideline organization in order to obtain more detailed information.</p>
<p>Using the information from these sources, it is then possible to develop a list of publicly traded companies that are in a similar business. It is from this list that an attempt to find guideline public firms needs to be made.</p>
<br/><h2>Determining the Number of Guidelines</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_image04.jpg"/><br/>
<p>The courts have rejected the use of only one company as a comparable &#8212; &#8220;One company does not a comparable make&#8221; (<i>Estate of Joyce C. Hall,</i> 92 T.C. No. 19 (1989)). The more similar the guideline companies are to the closely held business, the fewer guidelines that are needed, with a key factor being the level of market trading activity for the guideline firms. Generally, it is desirable to have four to seven comparable companies.</p>
<h2 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Factors to Consider</h2>
<p>Before public companies&#8212;i.e., the stocks of which are actively traded in a public market&#8212;can be used as guidelines, a mix of qualitative and quantitative factors must be taken into account. Again, the possible guideline company's website may contain more detailed information about their products, market segments, geographic regions, and other statistics. Does the guideline company serve a similar customer base with similar products or services to that of the subject organization? A multinational company would hardly be a comparable company to one that serves only the New England area.</p>
<br/><h3>Size</h3>
<p>Size is often a major difference between a closely held organization and a publicly traded company. Wal-Mart&#174; cannot be compared to a small family owned retail establishment serving a little neighborhood. An extremely large company cannot be considered to be comparable to a small, closely held one. What makes a possible guideline too large? One of the rules of thumb that is often used by valuators is to select a possible group of guideline companies that have sales no larger than 10 to 25 times the sales volume of the company being valued.</p>
<p>The important point here is that whatever the acceptable size difference, it is essential the companies also have similar products or markets as well as similar asset structures. For example, a guideline cannot use financing sources not available to the subject company, such as the sale of bonds.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;" >Financial Reporting and Normalization</h3>
<p>The valuator also needs to be aware of differences in how financial results are reported, or of the existence of unusual events. For example, if the subject company uses a FIFO inventory method and the possible guideline uses a LIFO inventory method, then an adjustment needs to be made so that the financials being compared use the same inventory valuation method. Another area where normalization adjustments might be required would include dealing with different depreciation methods, e.g., the firm being valued depreciates its fixed assets using the straight-line method while the guideline companies use an alternative approach such as an accelerated method. Also, if a company has a significant amount of operating leases there will be an artificially low enterprise value as the lease-based debt is ignored and also would have a correspondingly low EBITA since rental expenses would include interest costs. This can be adjusted for by adding the value of the lease to the market value of the debt and an implied interest expense to EBITA.</p>
<p>The information for such an adjustment is generally found in the notes to the financial statements. Another frequently needed adjustment would be one for an extraordinary event. Such an adjustment would be made to improve the comparability of the organizations. Often the closely held company's financial statements will need to be normalized.</p>
<br/><h3>Operating Trends</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_img4.jpg"/><br/>
<p>The next step in the search for a guideline company is to look for similar trends in operating performance. If the sales of the closely held organization had shown a healthy increase over the last few years, and the sales of a possible guideline showed a steep decline, then it is unlikely that the two organizations are operating in markets that react to various economic factors in a similar fashion. Also, even if both firms have been growing, the growth for one may have been due to acquisitions while the growth for the company being valued might have come from increased sales at existing locations; therefore, in both cases described, the potential guideline company would not provide a good comparison.</p>
<p>As noted above, size is often the major difference between a closely held organization and a publicly traded company. To deal with this problem, the valuator may wish to search for similar companies for which deals have recently been completed (purchases or mergers) that are not publicly traded companies. This is what is referred to as the Guideline Transaction Method. This may allow the valuator to overcome the size issue, but care must be taken to ensure that the level of detailed transaction information is available for the firm so that sufficient operating results can be determined.</p>
<br/><h2>Ratio Analysis</h2>
<p>Continuing with our analysis of the dwindling list of possible guideline companies, size and ratio analysis can provide a further verification as to whether a particular publicly traded company or guideline transaction company can be a reasonably comparable.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following example. You have been tasked with finding guideline companies for a grocery store. Using just a few of the possible ratios that can be easily calculated, and dealing with grocery stores with up to $1 million in annual sales, you can narrow down the list of potential guideline firms. You put together a comparison of the sales levels of the subject company and three possible guidelines as shown in the following table:</p>
<div style="margin-top:22.5px;">
<table class="lt" width="650">
<tr>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Ratio&#160;</th>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Closely Held Company</th>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Company A</th>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Company B</th>
    <th align="center" valign="top">Company C</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top">Sales</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">$ 475,000</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">$ 1,000,000</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">$ 625,000</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">$ 850,000</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>All of the possible guidelines fall within the size criterion, ranging from 1.3 times to just over twice the size of the subject firm. Through the use of ratios in the following categories, these three potential companies can be examined further.</p>

<h3>Liquidity Ratios</h3>
<p>Liquidity measures the adequacy of an organization's working capital (current assets) to meet the current obligations. In other words, does an organization have enough cash or other current assets that can be quickly turned into cash?</p>
<p><b>Current ratio</b> The current ratio focuses on the current assets that are available to honor the current liabilities that are incurred as a result of normal operations. The current ratio is a relative comparison of current assets to current liabilities. It calculates the number of dollars of current assets that are available to cover each dollar of current liabilities</p>
<p>Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities</p>
<p><b>The accounts receivable turnover ratio</b> The accounts receivable turnover ratio measures the quality and liquidity of the accounts receivable.</p>
<p>Accounts Receivable Turnover = Net Credit Sales/Average Accounts Receivable</p>
<p>The quality of the receivables is defined as collection without losses. It is assumed that the longer the receivables are outstanding, the less likely that they will be collected. The turnover is an indicator of the age of the receivables. It indicates how many times, on average, the receivables revolve (how many times they are generated and collected during the year). The credit terms should determine an expected turnover rate. For example, if the credit terms are net 60, it would be expected that the turnover would be six times if receivables were actually collected within the 60 days. A low actual ratio in comparison to the expected ratio may indicate the possibility of collection problems</p>
<p><b>The working capital turnover ratio</b> The working capital turnover ratio measures the sales created through the use of net working capital. Cash and accounts payable are used to purchase inventory that is then sold. Other current assets and current liabilities are used or incurred to support operations necessary to create sales</p>
<p>Working Capital Turnover = Sales/Net Working Capital</p>
<p>In other words, this ratio measures how effectively management uses current funds to create sales. A higher ratio in comparison to net working capital is preferred.</p>
<p><b>Inventory turnover ratio</b> The inventory turnover ratio measures the speed with which inventory can be converted into sales. In other words, the control that management has over inventory is assessed. The quality of the inventory is determined by the company's ability to use and dispose of inventory without a loss</p>
<p>Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold/Average Inventory</p>

<p>Since inventories are purchased for the purpose of obtaining a return, it is extremely important to determine if corrective action needs to be taken. Excessive inventories can lead to high storage and insurance costs, a greater risk of obsolescence, physical deterioration, or theft, tying up funds that could be used in a more productive fashion. This leads to decreased profits</p>
<p>Different inventory cost flow assumptions (FIFO vs. LIFO) can produce widely different inventory valuations and, thus, different turnover ratios. This can also lead to comparison problems between organizations. Therefore, when comparing the subject company to possible guidelines, it is important to be sure that the data is normalized, if necessary, to provide the same cost flow assumption for the companies being compared.</p>

<p>The current ratios of the subject company and the three possible guidelines are similar. The accounts receivable turnover, however, indicates that Company A does not appear to serve a market similar to the closely held store or Companies B and C. The working capital turnover and the inventory turnover also appear to identify Company A as being different, thus ruling out this particular company as a guideline.</p>

<br/><h3>Solvency Ratios</h3>
<br/>
<img src="images/cl_2a_pg20_1120.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Solvency is the organization's ability to meet long-term obligations (repayment of principal and interest) through the use of cash, or by converting non-cash assets into cash. Solvency ratios focus on whether a company can survive over the long-term and are closely related to financial risk. As the financing of the organization shifts from equity financing towards debt financing, the risk that the firm could default on long-term obligations increases. Solvency is also a matter of degree. A lack of solvency could lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the inability to refinance long-term debt at favorable rates, thus leading to lower profitability, or</p>
</li>
<li><p>a greater risk of defaulting on current maturities that could lead to bankruptcy and liquidation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial leverage is created when a portion of the company's assets are obtained through the use of credit (rather than cash) to finance the purchase; therefore, solvency is also related to the measurement of the use of leverage.</p>
<br/><p><b>To view this interactivity please view chapter 2, page 32</b></p><p><b>Interactivity information:</b><br/>
<p><b>The debt to equity ratio</b> The debt to equity ratio measures the relationship of debt to capital sources. The ratio of the dollars of debt per dollar of equity is determined. It shows the degree to which stockholders have a stake in the organization.</p>
<p>Debt to Equity = Total Debt/Total Stockholder Equity</p>
<p>The company's ability to meet long-term obligations is measured. From a creditor's point of view, the lower the ratio, the lower the risk of insolvency.</p>
<p><b>The times interest earned ratio</b> The times interest earned ratio measures the ability of the company to cover interest charges. This is important because, at minimum, a company would need to pay current interest charges</p>
<p>Times Interest Earned = Net Income Before Interest and Taxes/Interest Expense</p>
</p><hr style="width:25%;"/><br/>
<br/><p>A higher ratio is associated with greater solvency and demonstrates a greater margin of safety for the fixed interest payments. This ratio measures the ability to add new debt in the future.</p>

<h3>Profitability Ratios</h3>
<p>Profitability is the measure of success in terms of income defined by varying means over a period of time. In analyzing profitability, earnings are compared to a base such as sales, productive assets, or equity. Increased profitability provides the potential for increased dividend payments and stock appreciation. Increased profitability also provides greater security for debt holders.</p>
<p><b>The asset turnover ratio</b> The asset turnover ratio indicates how many dollars of sales were created by each dollar of total assets. It helps to determine whether the available assets were used efficiently to create sales. The goal of management is to create the highest possible amount of sales per dollar of invested capital. Note that a reasonable range for this ratio may be determined for each industry.</p>
<p>Asset Turnover = Sales/Average Assets</p>
<p><b>The return on assets ratio</b> The return on assets ratio measures the productivity of assets in terms of producing income. This ratio depends upon the organization's ability to get a high profit from each sales dollar while creating high sales per dollar of invested capital. A consistently high ROA is an indication that management is making effective decisions, and that the organization is a &#8220; growth company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Return Assets = Income/Average Total Assets</p>
</p><hr style="width:25%;"/><br/>
<br/><p>As in all turnover ratios, a high asset turnover is a desirable outcome as that would result from the effective use of available assets. Comparison between firms within an industry can be difficult due to the fact that the age of the assets used in the production of the sales may vary. This is a limitation caused by the use of historical costs, as opposed to current values for the productive assets. There is also a problem when comparing a capital-intensive firm to a labor-intensive one.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Applying these ratios to the subject company and the three possible guidelines results in the following:</p>

<p>Yet again, Company A does not appear to be an acceptable guideline to the subject organization. The important point to remember here is that the calculation of these ratios provides information about the subject company to the business valuator. The results of these calculations for the subject company must compare reasonably well to the calculations of those same ratios for potential comparable organization to remain on the list of possible guideline companies.</p>
<p>In the example, analysis of this nature, using quantitative factors, would suggest that Companies B and C may be comparable to the subject organization; thus, accepting them as potential guideline organizations. A similar analysis of key ratios should be performed for any company deemed to be a potential guideline. Such an exercise will help determine the range within which measurements for the closely held company should fall relative to the averages of the group of guideline companies.</p>

<h2>Guideline Public Valuation Method</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_image05.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Once financial comparability is established and a group of guideline publicly traded companies have been chosen, the next step is to do a step-by-step comparison of the closely held firm with each of the guidelines to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of the subject firm. Finally, if sufficient guideline companies have been found, the process culminates with the development of a &#8220;value measure&#8221; that can be applied to a specific variable of the closely held company to determine its estimated value. Such value measures are generally focused on some measure of earnings or invested capital. In our example, &#8220;earnings after tax&#8221; is used. Please note that in the example used that only two guideline firms are utilized. In practice, it would be necessary to have additional firms with appropriate comparability to the subject company.</p>
<br/><blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Taking Companies 1 and 2, the following table discloses that they have market values of $16.2 million and $15.6 million, respectively. This market value is the price of their stock times the number of outstanding shares. This translates into a simple average market value to earnings ratio for the guideline firms of 40.5:1. (Company A: MV to EAT of 40 + Company B: MV to EAT of 41)/2</p>

<br/><h2>Guideline Transaction Method</h2>
<p>Since the Guideline Public method uses publicly held firms as guidelines, information about these potential comparable organizations is readily available. Unfortunately the mere size, scope, and depth of operations of these public companies often makes them poor guidelines when valuing a small, closely held firm. However, in recent years, the ease of database technology has allowed for the establishment of databases&#8212;such as Done Deals, BIZCOMPS, Pratt's Stats, etc.&#8212;that contain information regarding actual sales of private companies, which would be companies that often are closer matches to the firm being valued.</p>
<p>There are potential problems introduced when using these databases. Often, there are no audited statements available, and the financial statement provided for the potential guideline company on these databases may include GAAP errors; thus, leading to potential comparability issues.</p>
<p>Once similar private companies included in one of the transaction databases have been found, an appropriate multiple or value measure needs to be determined and calculated such as was done in the above example using publicly held organizations. These value multiples are market-derived factors used to determine the value of a business or ownership interest, and can be based on several different benefit streams or other variables. Some commonly used multiples would include:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Price/Earnings (last 12 months or most recent year)</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Price/Gross Cash Flow</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Price/Revenue</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Price/Net Asset Value</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Market Value of Invested Capital/Net Sales</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Market Value of Invested Capital/EBITA</p>
</li>
</ol><br/><p>During the process of finding guideline transactions that seem to be well-suited to the subject of the valuation, it is also necessary to look at factors such as the reason for the potential guideline transaction being considered. Often, the name of the buyer will provide information. For example, if the purchase is for synergistic purposes, the price paid by the buyer might be inflated due to the specific gains that would accrue specifically to that buyer and not be available to a generic purchaser. Also, the purchase might be related to a forced liquidation in bankruptcy, which could tend to significantly reduce the sale price of the firm.</p>
<p>Once some number of companies found in the transactions databases have been established to meet the standards to be included as a guideline, the next step is to determine the appropriate multiple(s) and calculate the value as described in the example shown above using the Guideline Public Method. One good way to select the appropriate multiple(s) is to choose the multiple or multiples that are most tightly clustered in the industry of which the subject company is a part. This type of multiple would tend to be the most appropriate one to use in a value estimate. A wide dispersion of multiples often indicates a Valuation Ratio might not be meaningful for a particular industry. A Valuation Ratio is defined as a &#8220;fraction in which a value or price serves as numerator and financial, operating, or physical data serves as denominator.&#8221; (<b>International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms</b>, June 2001) The calculation value using multiples is demonstrated below.</p>
<p>Assume the median measures for guideline companies chosen from a transaction database are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MVIC/Sales &#8211; 0.697 (MVIC = market value of invested capital);</p>
</li>
<li><p>MVIC/EBITDA &#8211; 5.817 (EBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization); and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Equity Price/Earnings &#8211; 13.00.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is information about the subject company:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normalized sales &#8211; $34,389,893;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Long-term Debt &#8211; $5,756,374;</p>
</li>
<li><p>EBITDA &#8211; $4,160,881; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Earnings &#8211; $1,657,350.</p>

<p>Here we see that the estimated value for the first two measures is very similar but the value for the P/E ratio is significantly different. As a result, the analyst could consider that the Price/Earnings measure is not reliable to use in a valuation calculation for this particular industry.</p>
<p>If after determining several appropriate multiples, the results of a potential value for the subject company results in a wide range of results, the analyst might determine that the use of a guideline method is not appropriate since the wide dispersion of values cannot be easily explained nor reconciled. Delaware Chancery Court cited &#8220;Law of One Price&#8221;, concluding that a broad range of values resulting from comparables analysis to be too unreliable to be given significant weight. (<i>Cede &amp; Co. v. JRC Acquisition Corp., 2004 WL 286963</i> and <i>U.S. Cellular Operating Co., 2005 WL 43994.</i>) The <i>Law of One Price</i> is an economic term that states that in an efficient market all identical goods must have only one price, net of the price of transferring goods between the markets.</p>
<br/><h2>Study Question 20</h2><p>Seven guideline companies within the same industry have been found for the Joint Company. These guideline organizations have the following ratio averages:</p>

</table><br/><h1 style="margin-top:27px;" >2 D. Finding Guideline Companies</h1>
<p>When there are operating and nonoperating assets, returns from both types of assets must be considered. Except in the case of liquidation, the value is generally based on an expected future return since the business investor, like any other investor, is purchasing the right to future earnings.</p>
<p>To find potential guideline firms, it is necessary to obtain financial information about the firms that might be comparable. Finding such companies is an easier job today than just a number of years ago:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>First, there are a larger number of publicly traded companies to choose from.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Second, there are more small companies being traded on the open market&#8212;particularly NASDAQ&#8212;and smaller companies tend to be more comparable to closely held companies.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Third, many data sources have been developed that can facilitate obtaining basic financial information about these firms&#8212;and help the analyst determine the necessary discount for lack of marketability and the control premium.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>There are numerous resources available to aid the business valuator when searching for potential guideline organizations. For example, databases available over the Internet&#8212;or published on various optical storage media (e.g., CDs, or DVDs)&#8212;can provide historical information of five years or more for thousands of publicly traded firms along with the capacity of developing individual and aggregate ratios for a chosen group of firms or by industry. Other databases provide information on private firms; however, such records must be used with extreme caution since accuracy and/or consistency may be lacking. There is a great deal of data available, making the search for potential guideline organizations much easier than in the past.</p>
<br/><p>A key link for data sources providing a variety of information that can be used for the steps necessary for quantitative analysis for determining the viability of guideline companies is:</p>

<br/><h2>Issues</h2>
<br/>
<img src="images/stk_image06.jpg"/><br/>
<p>If this were all there was to finding guideline organizations, the process would be time-consuming but manageable.</p>
<p>Issues arise when qualitative factors are examined. Some of these factors involve a more in-depth examination of the financial information, and others require subjective judgment. Many of the issues described in the remainder of this chapter might force the business valuator to reject one or more of possible firms deemed to be in a similar line of business as the subject company as a guideline organization.</p>
<br/><h2>Study Question 22</h2><p>Finding guideline companies has been made easier through the use of currently available databases. Which of the following does <b><i>not</i></b> demonstrate this ease of research?</p>

</table><br/><h1 style="margin-top:27px;" >2 E. Problems with Guidelines</h1>
<p>Asset size is one of the variables most likely to eliminate many potential firms as possible guideline companies. Without considering anything else, size does not cause a problem, but it often serves as a proxy for other issues which set firms in the same line of business apart from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The firms in our previous example have similar debt-to-equity ratios, but the question often relates to type and availability of credit. Many large publicly traded firms have access to the bond market to raise funds, while some privately held companies might qualify for nothing more than a bank loan, which is limited by the personal guarantee of the owner. The issue here would relate to the ease of access to additional credit.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width:25%;"/>
<p>Many closely held businesses do not have&#8212;and cannot afford&#8212;the depth of management available to larger organizations. The owner of the small firm often wears many hats (e.g., CEO, engineer, accountant, human resource manager, marketing manager, etc.) compared to the larger firm, which has qualified individuals in each functional area. There is also greater risk in terms of succession in smaller firms. If the CEO of a larger organization dies or becomes incapacitated, there generally are qualified replacements available. If the owner/manager of the small firm dies, however, the company might be forced to liquidate, because there is often no one available to fill this individual's roles. The inheriting family members might not have the skills or desire necessary to keep the firm operating.</p>
<p>Closely held firms often produce only one&#8212;or no more than a few&#8212;products. As firms grow, they often diversify into different product lines in order to reduce the risk of having &#8220;all one's eggs in the same basket.&#8221; It is questionable if a single-product firm can be compared to a multifaceted company, even if they are in the same NAICS category.</p>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/stk_image07.jpg"/><br/>
<p>A closely held firm is frequently a small competitor and generally a follower rather than a leader in the industry. The subject firm most likely serves only the wholesale or retail segments of the business, while potential guidelines might serve both market segments. A potential guideline company might concentrate its activities in the segment not served by the firm being valued. In addition, a small firm that serves customers in a single geographic region of the United States might not be comparable to a firm that has a broad international customer base.</p>
<p>Publicly traded companies often pay dividends; however, most closely held organizations do not. The closely held corporation frequently increases the owner/manager's salary and benefits in lieu of dividends in order to avoid the double taxation of dividends. This compensation issue introduces an additional question concerning the possible need to normalize the financial statements of a closely held firm before they can be used in the valuation process. The normalization process is outside the scope of this course.</p>
<br/><p>These are the types of issues that courts and the IRS might raise when questioning the valuator's choice of guidelines. Many of the issues require subjective choices, and not all courts or IRS agents would rule the same in all circumstances. This may allow the valuator a degree of flexibility in defining what would be a similar firm, and unfortunately a biased valuator can potentially select guideline companies that will provide a sought-after result.</p>
<p>The potential exists that it will not be possible to find a sufficient number of guideline firms to use a method that utilizes guidelines in the valuation process.</p>
<p>Before the analyst can proceed in using other alternative approaches for valuation of estate- or gift-tax cases, it must be demonstrated that:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>an adequate number of guideline firms cannot be found, and</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(2)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>that the analysis procedures previously described provided the basis for arriving at this conclusion.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This has been a brief introduction to business valuation and the use of guidelines. Remember, the provisions of Revenue Ruling 59-60 and Regulations 20.2031-1(b) and 25.2512-1 suggest that it is desirable to base a business valuation upon historical facts that result in the use of guidelines. Although guideline firms are often difficult to find, the use of databases and Internet sources has made this once onerous task much easier than in the past. Care should be used to be sure to understand what is included in the data groupings found on the various databases. There often are questions related to consistency of date and data. The statements being compared need to be from the same approximate period, and an in-depth analysis needs to be performed on these financials looking carefully at such things as depreciation methods used, sources of financing, inventory valuation methods used, etc. Definitions vary from database to database for such items as ratios; therefore, a valuator needs to compare information with care.</p>
<p>Since the stock prices of publicly traded companies are the result of numerous trades by willing buyers and sellers, the exchange prices are considered objective. Business valuations that can be based upon the use of publicly traded guidelines can provide an effective valuation method supportable through the use of verifiable data. However, there are those who feel that a publicly traded company cannot be comparable to a closely held organization due to differences in size, capital structure, ability to obtain funding, diversity of markets, or diversification of products. In addition, the publicly traded stock price is based upon the sale of a minority interest, whereas the sale of an entire closely held company would represent a majority interest.</p>
<br/><br/>
<img src="images/stk_2e_52.jpg"/><br/>
<p>Using market multiples for a business valuation is a convenient approach. They represent a deceptively simple approach to business valuation and are often desired by courts and regulatory agencies. A disadvantage to this approach is that they do not cause the valuator to be required to think about the economic factors and firm specific variables impacting the subject company. Problems arise as the analysis moves further down the income statement (e.g., to net earnings) where the values are significantly more distorted than those further up the statement due to some of the issues inherent in GAAP.</p>
<p>Even with all the factors that make using the guideline methods problematic, the legal system generally requires that a genuine attempt be made to find either Guideline Public companies or Guideline Transactions before the market approach can be eliminated as a viable alternative for a particular valuation, and the valuator must supply documented reasons for bypassing the use of a market method in a particular business valuation.</p>

<h1>Business Segment</h1>
<p>The following terms and descriptions of business segments are taken from FASB ASC 280-10-50 (Segment Reporting).</p>
<p><b>Operating segment.</b> This is a component of an enterprise:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>that engages in business activities where it earns revenues and incurs expenses,</p>
</li>
<li><p>whose operating results are regularly reviewed by chief operating decision makers, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>for which discrete financial information is available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain operating segments may also be <i>reportable segments</i> (&#182;10).</p>
<p><b>Reportable segment.</b> Operating segments that meet one of the following quantitative tests are reportable segments (&#182;18):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Segment revenue (both to external customers and intersegmental) is at least 10% of total revenue of all operating segments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The absolute amount of segment profit (or loss) is at least 10% of all operating segments with a profit (or loss).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Operating segment assets are at least 10% of total assets.</p>
</li>

<h1>Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h1>
<p>The debt-to-equity ratio is a leverage ratio that measures the extent of financial leverage used by the firm and the creditor protection in the event of insolvency. It measures the balance between financing provided by creditors and by owners. Debt-to-equity is a transformation of debt and equity ratios. It increases exponentially as the firm uses a greater proportion of debt, approaching infinity.</p>
<p>The computation is total liabilities (debt) &#247; total owners' equity.</p>
<p>Limitations on use of this ratio include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The denominator reflects historical values, not current values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The items that are included in the totals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>preferred stock, which is usually considered <i>debt</i> for the purpose of this ratio;</p>
</li>
<li><p>equity, which is common stock;</p>
</li>
<li><p>contributed capital in excess of common;</p>
</li>
<li><p>capital leases, which are considered debt; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>retained earnings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Averages should be used in both the numerator and denominator.</p>
