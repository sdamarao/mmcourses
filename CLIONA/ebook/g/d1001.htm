<h1>Merger</h1>
<p>A merger is when one company (A) acquires another (B) with the latter (B) ceasing to exist: A + B = A. It is a fusion. It is when two or more companies physically combine operations with all but one ceasing to exist as a legally recognized entity. A merger must be accounted for as a purchase. Pooling of interests for new mergers is no longer allowed.</p>
