<h1>Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h1>
<p>The debt-to-equity ratio is a leverage ratio that measures the extent of financial leverage used by the firm and the creditor protection in the event of insolvency. It measures the balance between financing provided by creditors and by owners. Debt-to-equity is a transformation of debt and equity ratios. It increases exponentially as the firm uses a greater proportion of debt, approaching infinity.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">The computation is total liabilities (debt) &#247; total owners' equity.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">Limitations on use of this ratio include the following:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:18px;">
<li><p>The denominator reflects historical values, not current values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The items that are included in the totals are:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:18px;">
<li><p>preferred stock, which is usually considered <i>debt</i> for the purpose of this ratio;</p>
</li>
<li><p>equity, which is common stock;</p>
</li>
<li><p>contributed capital in excess of common;</p>
</li>
<li><p>capital leases, which are considered debt; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>retained earnings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Averages should be used in both the numerator and denominator.</p>

</ul>
