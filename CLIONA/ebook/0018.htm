<h3>Fair Market Value</h3>
<p style="margin-top:27px;">Fair market value is a concept that is used by courts and the IRS to settle disputed estate- and gift-tax issues. However, this concept is seldom used by a willing seller and a willing buyer. Transactions between third parties generally involve a negotiation process. As such, <i>value</i> is defined by what the seller is willing to accept and the buyer is willing to pay. For a business with above-average earnings for its industry, a buyer is often willing to pay a premium over the potential selling price of an average firm. If adverse economic conditions exist, a seller may be forced to accept a discounted sales price. Since many business valuations are prepared for purposes other than the actual sale to a third party, the concept of <a style="Color: #0078AE " title="Glossary Term:Fair Market Value (FMV)" onclick="parent.frames.frame_a.showGlossaryPopup('g/d1010.htm','Fair Market Value (FMV)')">fair market value</a> as defined by the courts and the IRS is extremely important.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">For estate-tax purposes (<font face="Sylfaen" size="2px">Reg. &#167;20.2031-1(b)</font>) and for gift-tax purposes (<font face="Sylfaen" size="2px">Reg. &#167;25.2512-1</font>), fair market value is defined as follows.</p>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>key term</b></span></p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, both parties having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. (Reg. &#167;20.2031-1(b)) Court decisions often assert that these hypothetical parties are able, as well as willing, to trade, and are <i>well-informed</i> about the property and the market for such property.</p>
</div>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">In other words, both the buyer and the seller have informed knowledge about the particular business being valued, the industry, the national and regional economy, and any other pertinent facts related to the company and the environment in which it operates.</p>
