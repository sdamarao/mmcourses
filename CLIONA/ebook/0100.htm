<h2>Guideline Transaction Method</h2>
<p style="margin-top:27px;">Since the Guideline Public method uses publicly held firms as guidelines, information about these potential comparable organizations is readily available. Unfortunately the mere size, scope, and depth of operations of these public companies often makes them poor guidelines when valuing a small, closely held firm. However, in recent years, the ease of database technology has allowed for the establishment of databases&#8212;such as Done Deals, BIZCOMPS, Pratt's Stats, etc.&#8212;that contain information regarding actual sales of private companies, which would be companies that often are closer matches to the firm being valued.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">There are potential problems introduced when using these databases. Often, there are no audited statements available, and the financial statement provided for the potential guideline company on these databases may include GAAP errors; thus, leading to potential comparability issues.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">Once similar private companies included in one of the transaction databases have been found, an appropriate multiple or value measure needs to be determined and calculated such as was done in the above example using publicly held organizations. These value multiples are market-derived factors used to determine the value of a business or ownership interest, and can be based on several different benefit streams or other variables. Some commonly used multiples would include:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:18px;list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Price/Earnings (last 12 months or most recent year)</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Price/Gross Cash Flow</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Price/Revenue</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Price/Net Asset Value</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Market Value of Invested Capital/Net Sales</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Market Value of Invested Capital/EBITA</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
