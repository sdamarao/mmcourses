<h3>The purpose of the valuation</h3>
<p style="margin-top:27px;">The first step in a business valuation is to determine the purpose of the valuation. Different purposes for the valuation will often necessitate the use of different valuation methods that will result in different values.</p>
<p style="margin-top:22.5px;">Why does this occur? There are different state and federal statutes and regulations, and these different conventions affect the approach taken to valuations. For example, divorce law is guided by state statute, and the standards of value used by the states can vary. The most common choices are fair market value, intrinsic value, and investment value. Remember, fair market value assumes that there is a hypothetical (not specific) buyer and a hypothetical seller, both with reasonable knowledge of the business situation. Intrinsic value assumes that the parties involved have a greater understanding of the business situation than the typical investor. Investment value is based on the standard of value for a specific investor. Obviously, these three valuation approaches would likely lead to different determinations of value.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:22.5px;">Valuation date</h3>
<p style="margin-top:27px;">The valuation date can also lead to different business values. Again, looking at the divorce situation, the valuation date used in a divorce proceeding could be the date of the marriage, the date of the separation, the date of the filing, or the date of the trial. Since there can be years between the date of the marriage and the date of the trial, the determination of value can differ as a result of the valuation date chosen.</p>
