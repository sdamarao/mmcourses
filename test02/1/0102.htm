<h2>Financial Information</h2>
<p>The third area of interest to the reviewer is all pertinent financial information, such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Cost of operations by periods</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Year-by-year record of income from revenue-producing operations</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Budget versus actual data for the present and past periods</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Cash flow analysis</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Cost accounting data</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Operating Methods and Procedures</h2>
<p>Normally, the reviewer is more concerned with operating data than with the data typically in a financial statement. A fourth area is investigated to obtain a general description of the organization's operating methods and procedures. The reviewer analyzes and documents the operating methods and procedures by which activities being reviewed are performed. In the planning phase, the reviewer should obtain information as to the general methods and procedures top management prescribes for operating in the area under consideration. In this phase, the review of methods and procedures should not extend below the management level. If it is necessary to get accurate information on which to base a conclusion of how certain systems and procedures actually work, the reviewer may want to talk with a limited number of operations personnel. The information obtained may be generalized and may require further development later in the review to determine the precise methods and procedures at the operating level.</p>
