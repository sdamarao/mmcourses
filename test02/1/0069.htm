<h2>Perform the Operational Review</h2>
<p>The proposal letter has been submitted and accepted by management. Now what? Now begins the actual operational review, using the proposed phase approach of planning, work program, fieldwork, development of findings and recommendations, and reporting. Should management request it, the reviewer might help to implement the recommended operational improvements. Otherwise, client personnel may feel confident that they can implement the agreed upon recommendations on their own.</p>
<h3>1. Identify Other Significant Operational Areas</h3>
<p>As part of the reporting process, it is also important to identify other significant operational areas where the operational review approach could offer specific improvements and quantifiable benefits. This could lead to a follow-up operational review engagement for the external consulting firm, particularly if it has proven its worth in the current operational review. For the internal review team, it could result in management's asking for additional operational reviews. Not only is such an approach productive in selling the entire operational review concept, but it also reinforces the concept of the internal review group existing as a &#8220;profit center&#8221; in the conducting of operational reviews. The &#8220;profit center&#8221; concept is based on convincing management that the benefits to be derived from operational reviews far exceed the costs involved. This is where the quantification of findings is extremely important.</p>
