<p><b>(F). Cost/Benefit Approach</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Operational reviews, to be most successful, require a large amount of pre-planning, fact gathering, and research. This can make the costs of conducting an operational review considerable. When compared with the potential benefits and savings, costs become less significant. That is why, when determining how much time to spend on the operational review, it is best to use a cost/benefit approach, tempered, of course, with the reality of available staff and hours. Effort should be made to cover competently as many of the major critical areas as possible within limited staffing constraints.</p>

<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>note</b></span></p>
<p>When performing a financial type audit, the audit group is budgeting staff time and related costs. In effect, the financial audit becomes a cost center. In an operational review, operational benefits and dollar savings should greatly surpass the cost of the review (savings should be at least three times its cost). In effect, the operational review becomes a profit center. Theoretically, the more operational reviews are done, the greater the savings realized by the organization. In reality, some guidelines are needed to establish the extent of an operational review in a given functional area, once the critical areas for the review are identified.</p>

<h3>5. The Initial Survey</h3>
<p>To achieve the greatest results from limited operational review resources, the reviewer identifies those areas of major importance and those offering the greatest potential savings or benefits. The identification of these areas is done as part of an initial survey, either prior to or as part of the planning phase of the operational review. If performed before the planning phase, either because the client requests it (perhaps a small scope or budget), or for some other reason, the survey usually consists of some type of management and operational questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire is to determine what functions are performed, who performs each function, why each is performed, and how each is performed.</p>
