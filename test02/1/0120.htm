<h2>Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Because members of the operational review team usually have some financial expertise, a good place to start in determining critical operational areas is to analyze the organization's financial data and statements. Keep in mind that financial statements, produced from a financial accounting standpoint, are essentially historical documents that present the organization's assets, liabilities, and equity in a balance sheet and its revenues and expenses in an income statement. These financial statements tell what has happened within the organization during a particular period or series of periods. These same financial statements can be used from an operational review standpoint to help identify present and future critical areas for review. The use of certain analytical tools can effectively help to analyze the financial statements, determine how the organization is doing, and zero in on critical areas that need attention and improvement.</p>
<h2>Comparisons</h2>
<p>Financial statements are primarily static historical documents showing data related only to a specific period of time. Operational reviewers are concerned with the period being reported, and what the trend of events has been and will be over longer periods of time. Accordingly, comparing financial statement data with the results of other periods, or of other organizations, provides a better understanding of trends and helps in making proper decisions as to their relative significance. Comparisons can be made with the historical performance of the company, a competitor's performance, performance of other organizations within the same industry, and organizational goals, objectives, and detail plans.</p>
