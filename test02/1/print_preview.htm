<p>Upon completion of this chapter, the user should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>identify operational areas in need of positive improvement&#8212;looking for best practices as part of a program for continuous improvements,</p>
</li>
<li><p>pinpoint the cause (not the symptom) of the problem&#8212;avoiding quick fix short-term solutions in favor of longer term elegant solutions,</p>
</li>
<li><p>quantify the effect of the present situation on operations&#8212;identifying the cost of present practices and the benefits to be derived through implementation of best practices, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>develop recommendations as to alternative courses of action to correct the situation&#8212;identifying best practices in a program of continuous improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>1 A. Introduction</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of this course is to help you understand the basic principles involved in planning and conducting an operational review directed toward the continual implementation of best practices in an organized program of continuous improvements. In addition, it will provide the information and fundamentals to use operational review concepts to enable you to operate most economically, efficiently, and effectively&#8212;that is, to maximize operating results at the least cost, using the most efficient methods.</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Management, supervisors, and other employees who desire to perform operational reviews for their operational areas of responsibility can use the materials presented in this course. In addition, others can use the tools and techniques presented&#8212;such as internal and external consultants and auditors&#8212;to maintain operations in the most economical, efficient, and effective manner.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>In today's many-faceted and multi-disciplined economic environment, organizational management has placed an increasing emphasis on increasing results with fewer resources through the evaluation of the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the organization's operations. The operational review is the tool used to perform such an evaluation&#8212;individually or as part of another procedure, such as benchmarking, activity-based management, Total Quality Management (TQM), reengineering, and so on. This course presents the basic principles of planning and conducting such an operational review as well as the fundamentals of which the reviewer must be aware, to understand operational review concepts.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Why Businesses Are in Existence</h2>
<p>A starting point for establishing operational review measurement criteria is to decide which businesses the organization is really in so that operational efficiencies and effectiveness can be compared to such overall organizational criteria. Before one even thinks about performing an operational review of an organization, it is necessary to determine why the organization is in existence. When clients are asked this question, invariably the answer is to make money. Although this is partly true, there are really only two reasons for a business entity to exist.</p>
<h3>1. The Customer Service Business</h3>
<p>The first reason an organization exists is to provide goods and services to satisfy desired customers, so that they will continue to use the business's goods and services and refer it to others. An organizational philosophy that correlates with this goal that has been found to be successful is &#8220;to provide the highest quality products and service at the least possible cost.&#8221;</p>
<h3>2. The Cash Conversion Business</h3>
<p>Another reason an organization exists is to create desired goods and services so that the investment in the business is as quickly converted to cash as possible, with the resultant cash-in exceeding the cash-out (net profits or positive return on investment). The correlating philosophy to this goal can be stated as follows: &#8220;To achieve desired business results using the most efficient methods so that the organization can optimize the use of limited resources.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Being in the customer service and cash conversion businesses enables the company to make money and to survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Businesses Not to Be in</h3>
<p>Once short-term thinking is eliminated, managers realize they are not in the following businesses and decision making becomes simpler:</p>
<p><b>(A). Sales Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Making sales that cannot be collected profitably (sales are not profits until the cash is received and all the costs of the sale are less than the amount collected) creates only numerical growth.</p>
<p><b>(B). Customer Order Backlog Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Logging customer orders is a paperwork process to impress internal management and outside shareholders. Unless this backlog can be converted into a timely sale and collection, there is only a future promise, which may never materialize.</p>
<p><b>(C). Accounts Receivable Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Get the cash as quickly as possible, not the promise to pay. Remember, customers are the company's business; keeping them in business is keeping the company in business. Normally, the company has already put out its cash to vendors and/or into inventory. It may even be desirable to get out of the accounts receivable business all together. This is particularly true for small sales where the amount of the sale is less than the cost of billing and collections or where major customers (e.g., 20 percent of all customers equal 80 percent of total sales) are willing to pay at the time of shipping or receipt as part of price negotiations.</p>
<p><b>(D). Inventory Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Inventory does not equal sales. Keep inventories to a minimum&#8212;zero if possible. Procure raw materials from vendors only as needed, produce for real customer orders based on agreed upon delivery dates, maximize work-in-process throughput, and ship directly from production when the customer needs the product. To accomplish these inventory goals, it is necessary to develop an effective organizational life stream that includes vendors, employees, and customers.</p>
<p><b>(E). Property, Plant, and Equipment Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Maintain at a minimum: be efficient. Idle plant/equipment causes anxiety and results in inefficient use. If it is there, it will be used. Plan for the normal (or small valleys) not for the maximum (or large peaks); network to outsource for additional capacity and in-source for times of excess capacity.</p>
<p><b>(F). Employment Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Get by with the least number of employees as possible. Never hire an additional employee unless absolutely necessary; learn how to cross train and transfer good employees. Not only do people cost ongoing salaries and fringe benefits, but they also need to be paid attention to&#8212;as any excesses in personnel results in unnecessary and costly organization building.</p>
<p><b>(G). Management and Administration Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The more an organization has, the more difficult it becomes to manage its business. It is easier to work with less and be able to control operations than to spend time managing the managers. So much of management becomes getting in the way of those it is supposed to manage and meeting with other managers to discuss how to do this. Management becomes the promotion for doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Knowing the businesses not to be in keeps the company in the businesses it should be in&#8212;and to grow and prosper.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Basic Business Principles</h2>
<p>Each company must determine the basic principles that guide its operations. These principles become the foundation on which the company bases its desirable operational practices. It is these basic business principles that must be considered in analyzing the company's operations during the conduct of the operational review. Examples of such business principles include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Produce the best quality product at the least possible cost.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Set selling prices realistically, so as to sell the entire product that can be produced within the constraints of the production facilities.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Build trusting relationships with critical vendors; keeping them in business is keeping the company in business.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>The company is in the customer service and cash conversion businesses.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Do not spend a dollar that does not need to be spent; a dollar not spent is a dollar to the bottom line. Control costs effectively; there is more to be made here, than increased sales.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Manage the company; do not let it manage the managers. Provide guidance and direction, not crises.</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Identify the company's customers and develop marketing and sales plans with the customers in mind. Produce for the company's customers, not for inventory. Serve the customers by providing what they need, not by selling them what the company produces.</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>Do not hire employees unless they are absolutely needed; and only when they multiple the company's effectiveness so that the company makes more from them than if they did it themselves.</p>
</li>
<li value="9"><p>Keep property, plant, and equipment to the minimum necessary to maintain customer demand.</p>
</li>
<li value="10"><p>Plan for the realistic, but develop contingency plans for the positive unexpected.</p>
</li>
</ol><blockquote>

<p>Basic business principles guide the company's operations.</p>

<h2>Organizational Basics</h2>
<h3>1. Criteria For Organizational Growth</h3>
<p>There are numerous criteria organizations may choose to implement in their programs of continuous improvement leading toward organizational growth. As part of conducting an operational review, the reviewer must be aware of these criteria to be successful in addressing the company's desired direction&#8212;in total or by business segment or function. Some of these criteria include the following:</p>

<h3>2. Mental Models And Belief Systems</h3>
<p>Many organizations operate on the basis of prevalent mental models or belief systems&#8212;usually emanating from past and present top management&#8212;which have an overriding effect on the conditions with which operations within the company are carried out. They can help to produce a helpful working environment or atmosphere or a hindering one. In effect, such mental models become performance drivers&#8212;those elements within the organization that shape the direction of how employees will perform their functions. Examples of such mental models and belief systems include the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Hard work and doing what you are told are the keys to success for the individual and the company.</p>

<h3>3. Organizational Criteria Results Structure</h3>
<p>The first step in successful operational review planning is to define the company's desired criteria for results as related to their reasons for existence, basic business principles, mental models, belief systems, performance drivers, and so on. These organizational criteria typically encompass the company as an entity as well as its major functions. An example of such an organizational results criteria structure is as follows:</p>
<p><b>(A). Organization-Wide Criteria</b> &#160;</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>

<p>In many organizations today, top management is grasping for ways to become competitive and maintain market position&#8212;or merely to survive.</p>
<h3>1. Detrimental Systems</h3>
<p>Managers have sensed that many of their organizational systems are detrimental to progress and have held them back. These are the very systems that are supposed to be helpful; for example:</p>

<h3>2. Helpful Systems</h3>
<p>Operational reviews, together with other techniques, are tools to make these systems helpful as intended and direct organizations toward their goals. Theoretically, organizations should operate in an economic, efficient, and effective manner at all times. If such were the case, operational review techniques would be applied on an ongoing basis; however, with the passage of time, good intentions and initially helpful systems tend to deteriorate. Operational reviews are then necessary to help get the organization back on the right track by pinpointing operational deficiencies, developing practical recommendations, and implementing positive changes.</p>
<h3>3. Accountability</h3>
<p>Managers at all levels should be held accountable for using the scarce resources entrusted to them to achieve maximum results at the least possible costs. Although management should embrace operational review concepts and apply them as they proceed, this is rarely the case. More typically, management needs to be sold on the value of operational reviews. In selling the benefits of conducting operational reviews, it is important to stress that, unlike other techniques that cost time and money for uncertain results, operational reviews pay for themselves. In effect, the operational review environment becomes a profit center instead of a cost center.</p>

<h2>The Operational Reviewer</h2>
<p>An operational review can be performed by anyone with the appropriate skills; however, internal and/or external consultants, because of their knowledge of the operations and their analytical skills, are typically requested to perform such services. In some organizations, a separate operational review unit trained in operational review concepts is established. The most effective way in which to implement such procedures is to assign overall responsibility for implementing organization-wide operational review procedures, which would include the performance of operational reviews as well as training operations personnel in implementing these techniques in their areas.</p>
<h3>1. Attributes</h3>
<p>The progress and ultimate success in achieving the benefits of operational reviews depend greatly on the reviewers&#39; skills and what management and others think of them. Those assigned to an operational review engagement must possess the ability to review and analyze financial, management, and operational areas. The attributes of an effective operational reviewer include the following:</p>

<h3>2. Additional Attributes</h3>
<p>Beyond those previously listed, the successful operational reviewer should possess the following attributes:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The ability to spot the trouble areas&#8212;to look at a given situation and quickly determine what is getting in the way</p>

</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The application of the 80/20 rule states that operational reviews require 80 percent common sense and 20 percent technical expertise; and that 80 percent of the trouble areas cause 20 percent of the problems, and that 20 percent causes 80 percent of the problems.</p>
</blockquote>

  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>

</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>This is sometimes difficult as many times the reviewer has never been in an operational related management position. Even when this is not true, the reviewer may have difficulty understanding the constraints under which the manager must work&#8212;in effect, what they can and cannot do.</p>

  <tr>

</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The success of an operational review is measured by the degree with which recommendations are implemented, and implementation is a direct by-product of effective communication. A rule of thumb is that the review has been successful if management is convinced to adopt more than 50 percent of the recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Operational Review Skills and Abilities</h3>
<p>The attributes of an effective operational reviewer would be helpful to any manager. While managers should have analytical ability, they may use it primarily to perform repetitive tasks. Operational reviewers, on the other hand, use these skills and abilities to assess a user's situations and recommend positive operational improvements.</p>
<p><b>(A). Balance</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The difference between required attributes for operational personnel and operational reviewers is similar to the difference between the left brain and the right brain. The left brain, which controls thinking and calculation processes, is more important to operations personnel performing repetitive tasks; whereas the right brain, which controls creativity and perceptual skills, is more critical to the operational reviewer. Basically, the operational reviewer needs a good balance of both, yet with a greater emphasis on the creative and perceptual side. This is why the best manager or operating personnel does not always make the best operational reviewer and why things tend to stay the same.</p>
<p><b>(B). Analytical Techniques</b> &#160;</p>
<p>To render effective services, the operational reviewer must have substantial knowledge of the total environment of the organization being examined and a high degree of skill and experience with the analytical techniques and tools needed to solve problems. The operational reviewer should also have sensitivity to, and understanding of, the values and goals of all the various people that make up a going concern.</p>
<p><b>(C). Problem Identification and Analytical Skills</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Someone trained in operating systems and procedures need not spend many years learning new methods before engaging in operational reviews, as the basic techniques are the same. They mainly need to sharpen the problem identification and analytical skills they already possess. Operational reviews can be viewed as 80 percent practical analysis and common sense and 20 percent technical know-how.</p>
<p><b>(D). Review Techniques</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The operational review requires the reviewer to possess a number of varied tools and techniques. The following are included among these review techniques:</p>

<h3>4. Recommendations</h3>
<p>Success as an effective operational reviewer is based on what is accomplished; that is, recommendations made to management that are subsequently implemented. Operational reviews should be fascinating and rewarding to the reviewer as well as operations personnel. The individual's stature as an operational reviewer, credibility of the entire review staff, management and others&#39; positive regard of the review staff all will increase in proportion to the degree of success attained in the operational review.</p>
<h3>5. Functional Disciplines</h3>
<p>Because of the number of different types and complexities of operational reviews and the varying skills required, supporting functional disciplines are often necessary to supplement the regular review staff's skills and abilities. It is not always practical to maintain personnel with all of the required skills on the operational review staff. One should consider the skills that are necessary for the successful conduct of each operational review, and either make sure that such skills are available on staff or contract for needed outside expertise.</p>
<h1>1 B. Operational Review Basics</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Operational review is a widely used term encompassing many aspects and techniques; however, no uniform, commonly recognized definition has been unanimously accepted. The definitions that have been given for operational reviews include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>An extension of the audit function into all operations of a business</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>The application of internal auditing to operations rather than financial controls</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>The identification of opportunities for greater efficiency and economy, or to improve effectiveness in carrying out operational procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>A control technique for evaluating the effectiveness of operating procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Nothing more than a review of controls, now including nonfinancial controls</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Review of activities other than those pertaining to examination of financial data</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Review technique that involves evaluating the efficiency and economy with which resources are managed and consumed</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>Review of operations with a management viewpoint</p>
</li>
<li value="9"><p>Review of operations made for internal management (i.e., not for external third parties) with the results circulated internally rather than externally</p>
</li>
<li value="10"><p>Combination of economy and efficiency and effectiveness or program results evaluation</p>
</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Combining definitions, it could be said that operational review is a review of operations performed from a management viewpoint to evaluate the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of any and all operations, limited only by management's desires.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Operational Review Concepts</h2>
<h3>1. Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>Operational review can be defined as a process for analyzing internal operations and activities to identify areas for positive improvement in a program of continuous improvement. The process begins with an analysis of existing operations and activities, identifies areas for positive improvement, and then establishes a performance standard upon which the activity can be measured. The goal is to improve each identified activity so that it can be the best possible and stay that way. The best practice is not always measured in terms of least costs, but may be more what stakeholders&#39; value and expected levels of performance.</p>
<h3>2. The Customer</h3>
<p>Operational review processes are directed towards the continuous pursuit of positive improvements, excellence in all activities, and the effective use of best practices. The focal points in achieving these goals are the customers, both internal and external. They establish performance expectations and are the ultimate judges of quality. A company customer is defined as anyone who has a stake or interest in the ongoing operations of the organization, such as the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Customers/end users: external</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>3. The Company</h3>
<p>Operational review results provide the company (i.e., owners, management, and employees) with data necessary for effective resource allocation and the strategic focus for the organization. The operational review process provides for those objective measures to determine the success of the company's internal goals, objectives, and detail plans as well as competitive performance measures. Evaluating the company's performance against stakeholder expectations enables the company to pursue its program of continuous improvement and the road to excellence. Effective operational review procedures encompass both internal and external needs.</p>
<h3>4. The Manager</h3>
<p>Managers who are responsible for an operational area have traditionally maintained the operation as they found it; that is, they primarily accepted the organization, personnel, and functions they inherited. They were not allowed or did not understand how to make their assigned area of responsibility more efficient. Many times, there were systems in effect (such as over-controlling bosses) that prevented such positive changes.</p>
<h3>5. Operational Viewpoint</h3>
<p>The purpose of the operational review is to assist managers and operations personnel to look at their areas of responsibility from an operational viewpoint. What do we mean when we say &#8220;from an operational viewpoint&#8221;? We mean that operations are viewed with an eye to whether one can improve operations to be performed more efficiently, effectively, or economically. Many times, the managers and employees of an operational area are too close to operations, are too resistant to change, are too enmeshed in daily operations, and so on to objectively review their own operations. Since, both internal and external consultants have the fact-finding and diagnostic skills needed to perform such operational reviews, they are frequently asked to do so. In some organizations, a separate unit is formed strictly to perform operational reviews.</p>
<h3>6. Intent of the Operational Review</h3>
<p>The intent of the operational review is not to be critical of present operations but to review operations and develop a program of best practices and continuous positive operational improvements by working with management and staff personnel. This can be accomplished most effectively by working with operations personnel in areas where they recognize deficiencies and are willing to cooperate. The concept of operational reviews should be sold as an internal program of review directed toward improved economies and efficiencies that will produce increased operational results.</p>
<h3>7. Quality of Operations</h3>
<p>Operational reviewing got its start when management stopped being concerned solely with reviewing reported information, and started wondering why a transaction was made in the first place and if there was a better way to do it. Operational review is the process whereby the reviewer determines whether management is using the resources entrusted to them in the most economical and efficient manner, to achieve the most effective results of operations. The focus and scope of operations have changed in recent years. Management has increased demands for more relevant information regarding the conduct of its operations and related results than can be found in strictly financial data. Management seeks information with which to judge the quality of operations and make operational improvements. That is why operational review techniques are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.</p>
<h2>Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness</h2>
<p>Operational review procedures embrace the concept of conducting operations for economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. The following is a brief description of each of the &#8220;three Es of operational reviews.&#8221;</p>
<h3>1. Economy&#8212;the Cost of Operations</h3>
<p>Is the organization carrying out its responsibilities in the most economical manner (i.e., through due conservation of its resources)? In appraising the economy of operations, and related allocation and use of resources, the reviewer may consider whether the organization is:</p>

<h3>3. Economy and Efficiency</h3>
<p>Economy and efficiency are both relative terms, and it is not possible to determine whether the area under review has reached the maximum practicable level of either. The reviewer and operations personnel are continually looking for best practices in a program of continuous improvements. Economy and efficiency are continually being appraised and improved upon. They are not put in place based on the operational review and then ignored.</p>

    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Economy and efficiency is concerned with achieving the optimum balance between costs and results. In performing this part of the review, the reviewer evaluates cost minimization, emphasizing reduction of costs, but not to the point where results are not accomplished. In addition, productivity maximization may be analyzed, but not to the point where the costs become excessive. In evaluating economy and efficiency, the reviewer analyzes the use of resources such as people, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money. For example, the reviewer might analyze the following:</p>

<h3>5. Operational Review Triangle</h3>
<p>The three Es of operational review&#8212;economy, efficiency, and effectiveness&#8212;or what may be referred to as operational review triangle are graphically presented in Exhibit 1.1.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The operational review process typically starts by analyzing the organizations planning systems&#8212;that is, to determine the agreed upon reasons why the organization is in existence and the related goals and objectives established by management to move them effectively in those directions. The budget system is looked at as the manifestation of the planning process by allocating scarce resources to the achievement of planning systems goals and objectives&#8212;encompassing the three Es.</p>

<h3>2. An Operational View</h3>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Were materials really needed? Were materials mistakenly ordered that could not be used owing to changes in production specifications, because the product specifications unit failed to communicate with the purchasing department?</p>

<h2>Why Perform an Operational Review</h2>
<p>What are some of the reasons an operational review should be performed? The focus and scope of many operations have changed in recent years. Management has increased demands for more relevant information on the conduct of their operations and the related results than can be found solely in financial data. Both business and government management seek more information with which to judge the quality of operations and make operational improvements. That is why we need operational review techniques to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.</p>
<h3>1. General Purpose</h3>
<p>An operational review involves a systematic review of an organization's activities in relation to specified objectives. The general purposes of the operational review could be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><b>(A). Assess Performance</b> &#160;</p>
<p>To assess performance is to compare the way an organization conducts its activities with: objectives established by management, such as organizational policies, standards, goals, objectives and detail plans; comparisons to other similar functions or individuals within the organization (internal benchmarking); and comparisons to other organizations (external benchmarking).</p>
<p><b>(B). Identify Opportunities for Improvement</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Increased economy, efficiency, or effectiveness is the broad categories under which most improvements are classified. The reviewer may identify specific opportunities for improvement (best practices) by analyzing interviews with individuals (within or outside of the organization), observing operations, reviewing past and current operational data, analyzing transactions, making internal and external comparisons, and exercising professional judgment based on experience with the organization or others.</p>
<p><b>(C). Develop Recommendations for Improvement or Further Action</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The nature and extent of recommendations developed in the course of operational reviews vary considerably. In many cases, the reviewer may be able to make specific recommendations. In other cases, further study not within the scope of the review may be required. The reviewer should be continually looking for best practices (both internal and external) in a program for continuous improvements.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>It seems that operations personnel would be involved in establishing and implementing recommendations. In most instances, such procedures are set by management, causing operations personnel to resist them. This works against them being successful. Organization structure tends to evolve over time, with minimal regard to economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Incentives</h3>
<p>In most organizations there are built-in incentives to increase organizational levels such as budget systems that reward larger organizations and politicking to build empires. It is the reviewer's role to identify such organizational inefficiencies and to recommend improvements. When the reviewers do this, they do not put themselves in the position of recommending specific individual cuts. Assuming that the organization's personnel are all good employees (and hiring, orientation, training, and promotion policies and procedures are adequate), the reviewer may recommend achieving desired results with less overall personnel. It is, then, management's responsibility to decide what to do with extraneous personnel; such as departmental transfers, retraining, lateral moves, etc. It is usually more desirable to be able to use existing good personnel somewhere else in the organization, than to terminate them.</p>
<h3>3. Specific Objectives</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why management desires to have an operational review performed. Keep in mind that management may be looking for a single objective (e.g., operational efficiency), a combination of objectives (e.g., least cost but most efficient systems, best practices), or their own specific agenda (e.g., achievement of results on the basis of cost versus benefits). Some specific objectives are as follows:</p>

<h2>Benefits of Operational Reviews</h2>
<p>Depending on its scope, an operational review can be of significant benefit to top management and staff, in some or all of the following ways:</p>
<h3>1. Identifying Problem Areas, Related Causes, and Alternatives for Improvement</h3>
<p>This is a major purpose of operational reviews. Although often aware of a problem, management cannot always define exactly its dimensions. The reviewer's third-party objective viewpoint helps to achieve the proper focus on operational problems. To define a problem in some instances, the reviewer need merely talk to operations personnel and then share her/his viewpoints with management. Keep in mind that people in operations are usually more aware of problems and their causes than management personnel. The reviewer's role is also to identify the actual causes (not the symptoms or believed causes) of problems, which may be the result of management policy or actions. Finally, the reviewer must formulate realistic, practical solutions to these problems. This is where the reviewer's experience in working with numerous other departments and/or organizations is valuable. Remember, organizations are always looking for best practices (internal or external) that can be practically implemented in a particular situation as part of a program of continuous improvement. A good rule for the reviewer to follow is not to recommend any course of corrective action that s/he could not assist in implementing.</p>
<h3>2. Locating Opportunities for Eliminating Waste and Inefficiency</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that each dollar of cost reduction (without sacrificing efficiency or effectiveness) contributes dollar-for-dollar to the bottom line. Cost reduction is a significant element in operational reviews. Be wary of short-term cost reductions causing long-term problems (e.g., downsizing of operations and/or personnel when business falls off). It is the role of the reviewer to assist the company to operate at the lowest possible cost in relationship to adequate plans. Costs should always be at the correct level, and when costs need to be cut, proper decisions are made so as not to adversely impact operations. This is in contrast to typical cost cutting across the board, which not only constricts all operations, but also fails to provide for the necessary resources for those operations that actually need increased funds.</p>
<h3>3. Locating Opportunities to Increase Revenues</h3>
<p>Increasing revenues also has an effect on the bottom line, yet only to the extent of profit margins for this additional amount of revenue. Increasing revenues may, in fact, be detrimental in terms of profits and operating efficiencies (both short-term and long-term profits). Often revenues or sales are increased to present a more favorable sales picture in the short term or to fill plant or service capacity, rather than on the basis of sound planning. Please note that in most organizations a greater amount of resources and emphasis is devoted to revenue improvement than to cost economies, even though effective cost cutting offers greater rewards.</p>
<h3>4. Identifying Undefined Organizational Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Procedures</h3>
<p>It would be nice to think that all organizations are doing effective long-term and short-term planning. In reality, this is usually more the exception than the rule. This means that the reviewer will have to assist management in recognizing undefined goals, objectives, and detailed plans and to assist in developing such plans prior to starting the operational review. For without defined plans, there are no yardsticks or milestones against which to measure the organization's effectiveness.</p>
<h3>5. Identifying Criteria for Measuring the Achievement of Organizational Goals</h3>
<p>There is great likelihood that plans and related goals and objectives are not in existence. Even when they do exist, there may not be appropriate criteria for measuring their achievement. The reviewer may have to assist management in the development of such criteria.</p>
<h3>6. Recommending Improvements in Policies, Procedures, and Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>The reviewer may find instances in which the cause of the problem lies with existing policies or procedures. Policies should be set by senior management and relate to the rules by which the organization conducts its business (e.g., service to the customer). Many times, such policies get in the way of operations personnel performing their functions (e.g., excessive controls and paperwork to process a customer credit) or insufficient authority is delegated to allow them to be most effective (e.g., sending a service representative to the customer to investigate a complaint). In these instances, the policies may be wrong and in need of correction.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Procedures are the ways in which functions are performed based on stated policies. As such procedures refer to operations, it might seem that operations personnel would be involved in establishing and implementing such procedures. In most instances, management sets procedures, causing operations personnel to resist them and work against their success.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The organization's structure tends to evolve over a period of time, with minimal regard to economy, efficiency, or effectiveness. In most organizations, there are built-in incentives to increase organizational levels, such as budget systems that reward the growth of organizations and encourage politicking to build empires. It is the reviewer's role to identify such organizational inefficiencies and to recommend improvements. It is then management's responsibility to decide what to do with extraneous personnel, possibly effecting departmental transfers, retraining, lateral moves, and so on. It is usually more desirable to use existing good personnel elsewhere in the organization than to terminate them.</p>

<h3>7. Providing Checks on Performance by Individuals and by Organizational Units</h3>
<p>Assuming that proper results have been defined for individuals and work units, it is the reviewer's responsibility to ensure that adequate checks or measurement criteria have been established to monitor progress towards their achievement. The reviewer must also ascertain that correct performance measures are being used&#8212;not just merely that they exist&#8212;and performance is being compared against them.</p>
<h3>8. Reviewing Compliance With Legal Requirements and Organizational Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Procedures</h3>
<p>The reviewer makes sure that the organization complies with the laws and internal rules under which it performs its functions. If there is a lack of compliance, the reviewer defines the consequences.</p>
<h3>9. Testing for Existence of Unauthorized, Fraudulent, or Otherwise Irregular Acts</h3>
<p>Such testing is normally a requirement for operational reviews, particularly where such acts have an adverse effect on operations.</p>
<h3>10. Assessing Management Information and Control Systems</h3>
<p>The reviewer will address a number of concerns in this area, such as the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Are reporting systems adequate to provide management and operations personnel the information necessary to effectively operate all aspects of the organization?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Is the level of detail commensurate to the level of operations (i.e., more detail at lower levels; less detail at higher levels)?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Is there information lacking that should be present?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Are all key operating indicators being considered (e.g., units shipped as well as items rejected and returned)?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>11. Identifying Possible Trouble Spots in Future Operations</h3>
<p>Many times the reviewer senses a future problem based on troubles in the past. For instance, problems with past computer conversions may indicate future troubles with an extensive computer processing upgrade.</p>
<h3>12. Providing an Additional Channel of Communication Between Operating Levels and Top Management</h3>
<p>In many organizations, there is a clear (or unclear) separation between management and operations; that is, management makes the decisions and operations personnel carry them out. One of the most important benefits of the operational review is the reviewer's ability to convey operational concerns to management in those instances where such concerns are not being communicated on an ongoing basis.</p>
<h3>13. Providing an Independent, Objective Evaluation of Operations</h3>
<p>Both management and operations personnel are often too close to what is going on within their own operations to effectively evaluate their results. The independent operational reviewer can do this objectively, pointing out those areas in need of improvement as well as those that are being performed well.</p>
<h1>1 C. Conducting the Operational Review</h1>
<h2>Operational Review Process</h2>
<p>Operational reviews consist basically of gathering information, making evaluations, and developing recommendations where appropriate. An operational review is essentially the evaluation of an activity for potential improvement and opportunities to increase profit. Management has the primary responsibility for proper planning, conduct, and control of activities. The way management plans, conducts, and controls the activities becomes a major consideration and focal point in the conduct of the review. In addition, the review includes analyzing results and being alert to problems. The review also provides insights into the effectiveness of management and the potential for improvements.</p>
<h2>Specific Purpose</h2>
<p>In conducting an operational review, one should be aware of the purpose for conducting the review. Prior to the start of the operational review, the reviewer should communicate clearly her/his understanding of the purpose(s) to appropriate management personnel. There should be a mutual agreement as to the purpose in the beginning. For example, the purpose could be one or more of the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>To review and evaluate the adequacy of the accounting system and related internal accounting controls (including both accounting and administrative controls)</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>To analyze systems and controls; as related to internal controls, functional operations, and legal compliance</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>To analyze the capability to accomplish agreed-upon stated goals, objectives, and results in management's approved plan</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>To compare actual accomplishments/results with the goals and objectives established in management's plan for the period; and to determine reasons that established goals and objectives were not met</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>To analyze and explain cost overruns or high unit costs for each function/activity for which such data can be quantified</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>To assess and evaluate compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations; ensuring at least minimal compliance</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>To identify and report deficiencies and areas for improvement and to provide technical assistance and follow-up where necessary</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Types of Review and Review Phases</h2>
<p>The operational reviewer may perform two types of review: preliminary and in-depth. The difference between the two is the degree of emphasis, the specific techniques chosen, and the objectives of a particular phase. In a preliminary review, fieldwork might consist of limited transaction testing and interviewing. The report may be a briefing to management. In an in-depth review, fieldwork might consist of detailed examination using techniques such as work measurement, workload analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and so on. The report may be formally written, with wider distribution. Each of the two types of reviews has five phases. The operational review phases can be described as follows:</p>
<h3>1. Planning</h3>
<p>The reviewer obtains general information about the kinds of activities performed, the general nature of those activities and their relative importance, and other general information to help plan the early portions of the review.</p>
<h3>2. Work Programs</h3>
<p>The reviewer prepares the operational review work program for the preliminary review of those activities selected for review in the planning phase. Well-constructed work programs are essential for conducting operational reviews in an efficient and effective manner. Such programs must be individualized for each situation, and each work step must state clearly the work to be done and why.</p>
<h3>3. Fieldwork</h3>
<p>The reviewer analyzes operations to determine the effectiveness of management and related controls. Such functions and controls are tested in actual operation, with particular emphasis on areas difficult to control and having high potential for weakness. The purpose of this phase is to determine whether a situation needs improvement, whether it is significant, and what should be done about it.</p>
<h3>4. Development of Findings and Recommendations</h3>
<p>Based on the significant areas identified during the fieldwork phase, specific findings are developed according to the following attributes:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Condition: What did you find?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Criteria: What should it be?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Effect: What is the impact on operations?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Cause: Why did it happen?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Recommendation: What needs to be done to correct the situation?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>These are based on present best practices and always subject to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. Reporting</h3>
<p>The reviewer prepares the report relative to the results of the review. The purpose of the report is to bring these results to the attention of those having an interest in or responsibility for the findings. In reality, the majority of findings, if not all, should have been reported to management with remedial action already being taken or completed prior to the formal report. The report becomes a summary of the results of the review.</p>
<h2>What Functions to Review</h2>
<p>The most critical question to answer for an organization is what function or functions to include in the operational review. Where shall we review? Do we perform the operational review for all functions of the organization or for only selected areas? A good starting point is to list the organization's major functions, to check off those where operational review would be most helpful, and then to prioritize each function as to its criticalness and/or the desired order of review.</p>
<h3>1. Overall Organizational Operation</h3>
<p>One way to decide which functions to review is to determine how critical each function is to the overall organizational operation. For instance, for a manufacturing business, the most critical area might be the inventory or production control functions. For a service-oriented concern where personnel cost approximate 70 percent of total expenditures, the personnel function would be more critical. Normally, reviewers work with a limited budget in terms of hours allocated to the operational review, so they are greatly concerned with spending these hours on functional areas that offer the greatest potential for operational improvements in return for their effort. Criteria for determining a company's critical areas include the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas with large numbers in relationship to other functions; e.g., such as revenues, costs, percentage of total assets, number of sales, units of production, and personnel</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where controls are weak; e.g., a lack of an effective manufacturing control system, management reporting system, or organizational planning and control system</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas subject to abuse or laxity; e.g., there may be inventory and production controls that allow transactions to go unreported and undetected, uncontrollable time and cost reporting, and ineffective personnel evaluation procedures</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas that are difficult to control; e.g., there may be ineffective storeroom, shipping, or time recording procedures</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where functions are not performed efficiently or economically; e.g., there may be ineffective procedures, duplication of efforts, unnecessary work steps, inefficient use of resources, such as data processing equipment, overstaffing, and excess purchases</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(F)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas indicated by ratio, change or trend analysis; such as characterized by wide up or down when compared over a number of periods. Examples include sales changes by product line, costs by major category, number of personnel, inventory levels, and so forth.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(G)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where management has identified specific weaknesses or needs for such as personnel functions, manufacturing procedures, data processing operations, and management reporting</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>2. Willingness</h3>
<p>Another factor to consider when choosing critical operational areas to review is the willingness of the personnel to cooperate in the performance of the review. First, those in operational management should want to have their operations reviewed and be willing to work with the reviewers in improving their operations. Without such top-management commitment, the operational review is not likely to succeed. Second, staff and operating personnel must be willing to work with the reviewers both in performing the operational review and in the subsequent implementation of operational improvements.</p>
<h3>3. Cooperation</h3>
<p>Cooperation at all levels of the organization is essential to a successful operational review. The reviewer must enlist the cooperation of all personnel; members of management to ensure top commitment to the review, and operations personnel to help in identifying areas to review and proposed improvements. Normally, in most operations, the staff or operating personnel know precisely what is going on day by day, and with firsthand knowledge of operations, can help you to identify the most critical areas to review.</p>
<h3>4. The Budget</h3>
<p>In addressing the number of critical areas to be covered in the operational review, it is important to understand the relationship between budgeted review time and the scope of operational review work to be accomplished. In many situations, the budget hours are established first and then the scope of the operational review is made to fit within the budget. While this procedure may work from an internal standpoint in regard to budget and staffing, it does not fully take into account the aspect of such reviews that require flexibility and expandability of formulated operational review work programs. In addition, it is important for the reviewer and management to consider the cost against the expected benefits of the specific operational review. This is a significant concept in helping to determine how much time to allocate to the operational review. There are a number of factors to consider in establishing the operational review budget. They include the following:</p>
<p><b>(A). The Scope of the Operational Review</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Are all significant operational areas to be reviewed, or only the major ones identified?</p>
<p><b>(B). The Frequency of the Operational Review</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Is the operational review to be done on a one-time basis, which requires more up-front planning and research; or is it to be performed for an area that is reviewed on a regular basis and requires minimal up-front efforts?</p>
<p><b>(C). The Nature of the Business Operations</b> &#160;</p>
<p>For example, a service business dealing primarily with selling staff time, such as a medical, legal, or a CPA practice, would normally require less time for an operational review than a manufacturing business that produces, ships, sells, and services a fairly wide product line.</p>
<p><b>(D). The Degree of Management Effectiveness</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Functional areas that are ineffectively managed will normally require more operational review time than those that are more effectively managed.</p>
<p><b>(E). The Expectation of Benefits</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Those areas that afford the greatest expected benefits, in terms of the number of potential recommendations or savings, should be the areas reviewed first; however, these areas will take more time to review than those with lesser expectations.</p>
<p><b>(F). Cost/Benefit Approach</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Operational reviews, to be most successful, require a large amount of pre-planning, fact gathering, and research. This can make the costs of conducting an operational review considerable. When compared with the potential benefits and savings, costs become less significant. That is why, when determining how much time to spend on the operational review, it is best to use a cost/benefit approach, tempered, of course, with the reality of available staff and hours. Effort should be made to cover competently as many of the major critical areas as possible within limited staffing constraints.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>When performing a financial type audit, the audit group is budgeting staff time and related costs. In effect, the financial audit becomes a cost center. In an operational review, operational benefits and dollar savings should greatly surpass the cost of the review (savings should be at least three times its cost). In effect, the operational review becomes a profit center. Theoretically, the more operational reviews are done, the greater the savings realized by the organization. In reality, some guidelines are needed to establish the extent of an operational review in a given functional area, once the critical areas for the review are identified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. The Initial Survey</h3>
<p>To achieve the greatest results from limited operational review resources, the reviewer identifies those areas of major importance and those offering the greatest potential savings or benefits. The identification of these areas is done as part of an initial survey, either prior to or as part of the planning phase of the operational review. If performed before the planning phase, either because the client requests it (perhaps a small scope or budget), or for some other reason, the survey usually consists of some type of management and operational questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire is to determine what functions are performed, who performs each function, why each is performed, and how each is performed.</p>
<p><b>(A). Search for Insight</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Answers to these questions should provide insight into the organization's objectives, activities, work performance, systems and procedures, limits of authority, and so on. The reviewer uses the questionnaire as a guideline and does not rely solely on yes-or-no responses. This is a quick review tool to help identify critical areas for further review where it is not feasible to implement the more desirable but time-consuming, full-planning phase. A survey of this kind should not be used in lieu of the planning phase, as it is still the reviewer's responsibility to substantiate, with adequate evidence, the identification of critical operational areas to be reviewed.</p>
<p><b>(B). Example of Survey</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Exhibit 1.3 is a sample operational review initial survey form. The purpose of the initial survey is to identify areas of major importance in the total organization or specific operations to be reviewed. Improper identification results in spending unnecessary effort on less significant activities and insufficient effort in more important areas. The survey should provide for more detailed answers, rather than simple yes-or-no responses. The same questions are reviewed with various personnel; such as departmental management, functional supervision, and operations and support personnel. The reviewer thus isolates patterns of agreement and disagreement, as well as various interpretations and perceptions that lead to the correct conclusions. Where necessary, each question is supported by available documentation. This form could also be used as part of the more formal planning phase, but should be more specific to a departmental or functional area.</p>

<h2>Engagement Development</h2>
<p>An operational review could be conducted by an external consulting firm, an internal review group, an independent in-house unit, departmental personnel, or a combination of staff from these entities. Whichever organization has primary responsibility for conducting the operational review, the major steps in its development and performance should be similar.</p>
<h3>1. Recognize and Define the Problem</h3>
<p>The first step is to recognize and define the problem. Normally, it is management's prerogative to identify the major problem area or areas to be addressed in an operational review. If requested by management, the reviewer can assist in such problem definition as described previously, or the reviewer may perform a preliminary survey to identify significant operational areas to be reviewed.</p>
<h3>2. Gather Appropriate Data</h3>
<p>The second step is to gather the appropriate supporting data, and is usually accomplished by the operational reviewer. The purpose of this data gathering is to provide background information relative to the problem areas defined, so as to substantiate the problem situation.</p>
<h3>3. Evaluate the Situation</h3>
<p>The next step is to evaluate the situation within the organization to determine such things as the organizational structure and resources available. These are the factors on which the reviewer bases the proposal to management for conducting the operational review.</p>
<h3>4. Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>The reviewer has gathered sufficient background data on the operational problem areas identified for review, and has decided on the plan for conducting the operational review. Now, the reviewer needs to submit a written proposal or engagement letter to clarify for management such considerations as the following:</p>

<h3>5. External consulting Firm</h3>
<p>An external consulting firm proposing to perform an operational review for a client may have to estimate time and costs before starting an engagement. To do this requires sufficient initial survey work and adequate prior experience on similar engagements to enable the reviewer to estimate accurately. While it is obviously advantageous to estimate the amount of fieldwork required after completion of the planning phase, the client normally wants to know these amounts upfront. The samples provided are for a relatively sizable operational review. In a situation where potential operational review engagements may be smaller in scope, the two phases may be combined and the numbers scaled down.</p>
<h3>6. Internal Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>Although it is usually an external consulting firm that submits a proposal letter to management, it is also good practice for an internal group to submit a similar proposal prior to the start of the operational review engagement. The major purpose of such an internal proposal letter is to ensure clear communication, as to the purpose and scope of the operational review, between the review group and management. In this context, the internal proposal becomes a letter of understanding between the internal review group and management. The contents of the internal proposal letter would differ somewhat from an external proposal, and would only include those areas necessary to the situation.</p>
<h3>7. Sample of Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>An example of an operational review proposal letter is shown in Exhibit 1.4, with an accompanying sample time and cost budget estimates for the conducting of the operational review in Exhibit 1.5. These cost estimates are for the reviewer's use in determining the cost of the engagement and are not given to operations management.</p>
<p>Exhibit 1.4&#8212; Sample Proposal Letter (is available as pdf supplement through this link and Tools).</p>
<h2>Perform the Operational Review</h2>
<p>The proposal letter has been submitted and accepted by management. Now what? Now begins the actual operational review, using the proposed phase approach of planning, work program, fieldwork, development of findings and recommendations, and reporting. Should management request it, the reviewer might help to implement the recommended operational improvements. Otherwise, client personnel may feel confident that they can implement the agreed upon recommendations on their own.</p>
<h3>1. Identify Other Significant Operational Areas</h3>
<p>As part of the reporting process, it is also important to identify other significant operational areas where the operational review approach could offer specific improvements and quantifiable benefits. This could lead to a follow-up operational review engagement for the external consulting firm, particularly if it has proven its worth in the current operational review. For the internal review team, it could result in management's asking for additional operational reviews. Not only is such an approach productive in selling the entire operational review concept, but it also reinforces the concept of the internal review group existing as a &#8220;profit center&#8221; in the conducting of operational reviews. The &#8220;profit center&#8221; concept is based on convincing management that the benefits to be derived from operational reviews far exceed the costs involved. This is where the quantification of findings is extremely important.</p>
<h3>2. Client's Personnel</h3>
<p>Another aspect to consider is that if the operational review is performed properly with the help of departmental personnel, the department retains the residual ability to perform operational review procedures in other areas. As the operational review team cannot normally cover every operational area that could be improved within the scope of the original operational review, the team should identify those additional areas for further review and, possibly, for review by the department. Management then decides whether to pursue these areas on their own or with the operational reviewer's help.</p>
<h3>3. Effectiveness of the Reviewer</h3>
<p>One of the goals in acquainting an organization with the operational review approach is to multiply the effectiveness of operational reviewers. In other words, while performing the operational review, reviewers are also training client personnel. In this way, operational review procedures and results are quickly multiplied throughout the organization, and the reviewers can then spend their time on the most significant areas and tasks.</p>
<h1>1 D. Case Situation</h1>
<h2>Leasing Insurance Costs</h2>
<p>During the course of your operational review procedures, you found that the company was paying for liability and property damage insurance as part of their lease agreement on 14 tractors and 19 trailers. The cost of the insurance was hidden in the fixed weekly/mileage rates billed by the lessor. The company's policy is to self-insure or assume certain risks (such as auto collision and certain other property losses, and the front end of unknown claims such as liability claims) and to purchase protection for any other risks under a blanket policy.</p>

<h3>2. What Happened in Real Life?</h3>
<p>In a &#8220;real life&#8221; version of this particular situation, it was found that lessor insurance costs totaled $39,000 for the year, and that the costs under the company's self-insurance and blanket policy would have been $6,000. Accordingly, an annual savings of $33,000 was realized by reverting back to the self-insurance policy. This situation would be reviewed periodically in the future to ensure that conditions had not changed or that other best practices had come into existence.</p>
<h1>1 E. Case Study: Joe Sorry, Inc.</h1>
<h2>Background of Situation</h2>
<p>If the basic purposes for being in business, that is customer service and cash conversion, are understood, how have so many businesses gone astray? To illustrate some of these principles and the application of operational review concepts, let me share the story of one of my consulting clients whom we will call Joe Sorry. Joe was a professional friend of mine working for a large national electronics organization, as a top middle manager, but who wanted to have his own business. He knew he could run a business better than his present employers. He decided he was ready and hired me to assist him in putting his business together.</p>
<p>Joe had been employed by ACE Electronics for nearly 20 years, serving in a number of Engineering and manufacturing positions at various locations. Presently, Joe was assigned as plant engineer to a small division manufacturing specialty printed circuit boards for a select number of customers. The company had always looked at this division as a sharer of overhead, not as a growth profit center. In fact, the division shared manufacturing space with a larger division and was considered a divisional &#8220;step child.&#8221; The company had recently been purchased in a leveraged buyout, and the new owners were going through a program of divestiture and selling off of various divisions and facilities; as well as a program of cost cutting and employee downsizing.</p>
<p>Joe's division was one that the new owners decided to put up for sale. Joe was eager to buy it, since he felt very strongly that with the sale of his division he would be let go. He also believed that he could do a better job of managing and operating the division on a full time basis than was presently being done by the parent company on a &#8220;step child&#8221; type basis. Joe saw good potential for additional sales as the present company mainly treated this division as a specialty house for their existing customers. He also foresaw numerous possibilities for cost savings through production efficiencies. He believed that inefficiently sharing space and manufacturing processes with the main division accomplished present production. In addition, by breaking away from the company, he believed this division could be operated at much less administrative cost and would not have to share the inequitable share of overhead burden allocated to them. Joe had no doubt that he could improve operations dramatically within the first year, and growth possibilities were extremely attractive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Joe chose to purchase and start a business in which he knew something about&#8212;as he had been the plant engineer for his previous employers&#39; electronics business. While he did not know everything there was to know about running a business; such as finance and accounting, sales and marketing, production and inventory control, purchasing, etc.; he knew that in this business (at that time) it was fairly easy to produce a quality product for less than customers were willing to pay for it. He had seen his previous employer making bundles of money (in his terms) from this division in spite of themselves and their gross inefficiencies. He was certain that their internal reporting and allocation systems had made this division look worse than it was and a prime candidate for sale. Joe knew he could do better.</p>
<h2>Financing the Business</h2>
<p>Joe had acquired some financial backing (other than his and his wife's savings&#8212;and his children's college fund) from his in-laws. Although Joe had some basic accounting knowledge, he did not have strong financial and accounting skills, but he knew he had to present some kind of projected numbers to acquire the additional financial backing he needed from others. For this purpose, Joe developed the following income statement projection, comparing the last year of ACE Electronics operations (in millions of dollars) with the projected future goals of Joe Sorry Company's operations:</p>

<p>Based on the above projection, which Joe believed was relatively realistic, Joe performed no further financial studies and his financial backers requested no additional data. Joe believed that through his efforts he would be able to easily meet the targeted increase in sales, decreases in costs of manufacturing and selling and administration, and resultant improvements in profitability. The combination of these factors should be enough to avoid any financial difficulties.</p>
<h2>Missed Considerations</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Joe's projections proved inadequate. He had not taken into consideration three significant factors:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Investment of over $2 million dollars in plant and equipment to gain all of his projected manufacturing efficiencies. Remember the previous owners operated on a shared plant basis and Joe had to start from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Increase in sales to achieve his sales target from present customers and adding new customers would require increased sales efforts, possible lowering of prices, a more favorable credit terms. The previous owner did not actively look to increase this part of their business, as they saw it as a specialty service to their present customers.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>It would take time (probably at least 3 years) to achieve the projected sales volume of over $500,000 monthly sales to attain the $6,300,000 annual target.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>ACE Electronics Position</h2>
<p>ACE Electronics had enjoyed a unique position in their specialty circuit board division as demand for its products by existing customers exceeded its ability to supply the products. The division was able to sell all of its monthly allocated production quota of about $300,000 on a continuing basis with no real effort. Due to the nature of the specialty of the product to its customers, ACE could require in most cases cash payment at the time of delivery. ACE was also able to dictate delivery schedules that allowed them to intersperse their specialty board manufacturing into idle production slots of the main division. This was basically the concept and philosophy of the specialty board division&#8212;that is to fill in production gaps and assume some of the overhead of the main division.</p>
<h2>Joe's Operating Results</h2>
<p>When Joe took over the specialty boards division, the division had reached a plateau of about $300,000 in monthly sales, with operating profits in the 7&#8211;8 percent range. Joe set up an expansion program with a goal of increasing sales by at least 50 percent with an operating profit margin in the 20&#8211;25 percent range. Although Joe did not achieve these goals the first year, by the third year his program was proving successful. His current monthly financial report showed that sales had increased to over $500,000 with over $100,000 in net income as shown below:</p>

<h2>Cash Flow Considerations</h2>

Joe had always assumed that a profitable operation would automatically provide for enough cash.

<p>As Joe learned, even with the most successful businesses in terms of sales and net income, resources always have their limitations. Since Joe believed he understood the product side of the business, Joe hired us to conduct an operational review of his business to help put the business side together.</p>
<h2>Educating the Client</h2>
<p>The first thing Joe wanted explained to him was if he was making so much money, why did the business not have any cash? Obviously, Joe's cash deficit was not due to anything magical, but developed predictably from his normal business operations. I explained a number of things to Joe about accrual accounting versus operational data, mainly:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Sales are recorded when made (goods shipped to the customer); and set up as accounts receivable; with cash being received at the time of payment.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Expenses are made on a different timing schedule from cash receipts. For example, payroll is paid when due, although you may not receive payback via customer sales until sometime in the future (typically over 30 days hence). This is also true of manufacturing costs such as materials and supplies.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Profits shown on the income statement are based on accrual accounting&#8212;that is sales are recorded when made not when accounts receivable are collected, and expenses are recorded as incurred not when they are paid from accounts payable.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Some expenses are handled via accounting entries such as depreciation and amortization, while prepaid items are recorded currently but they represent prior cash disbursements.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Expenditures for fixed assets, inventory, and other &#8220;deferred&#8221; expenses are paid for currently but do not immediately appear on the income statement.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Financial statements do not provide all of the necessary data needed to manage and operate effectively. For instance, the costs and profits generated for each manufacturing order, the number of on-time deliveries, the amount of returned merchandise, the amount and cost of rework, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Based on the above, Joe's profit for the current month of $101,000 turned into a cash deficit of $85,344. This exemplifies the difference between profitability and liquidity, and accrual versus operational reporting. Had Joe understood these principles, he could have avoided such operational problems. We agreed that we would look at the major aspects of Joe's operations during the course of our operational review.</p>
<h2>Preliminary Survey</h2>
<p>As part of the operational review process, it is good practice to meet with the client initially and perform a preliminary review of their operations&#8212;prior to submitting a proposal letter (or internal letter of understanding) as to the scope of the review and related fees. This preliminary review is normally performed at no cost to the client and takes from a half to a full day. It is your means to learn about the client and develop a proposal that incorporates the client's major critical operational areas into the operational review, so that you can provide the greatest benefit to their operations.</p>
<h2>Understanding Basic Business Principles</h2>
<p>I started with Joe by explaining what I considered some basic business principles. Joe generally agreed with these principles although he, like many new business owners, had visions of sugarplums in his head as to having enormous physical plant and employees under his control. He wanted to be automatically large just like his previous employer; making the assumption that more was better. Joe wanted immediate gratification for being the boss and felt he should have the same perquisites as he had before. When I explained to him that when he worked for the large corporation he was spending &#8220;other people's money&#8221; (OPM), and now he was spending his money (OCI or our children's inheritance), he seemed to understand.</p>
<h2>Business Background</h2>
<p>While he still wanted the big corporation comforts, he now was not willing to spend his money; for he realized that an unnecessary dollar spent in the business was a dollar out of his pocket. As part of the preliminary survey I talked to Joe to acquire a background of his business and his present position. Joe told me that he initially started his business, after acquiring it from ACE Electronics, in a large garage (that used to be a bicycle repair shop) with low rent. At that time, he and his wife Flo were the only employees. Joe started with three small contracts for specialized printed circuit boards that Joe had developed while previously employed at ACE. He established relationships with four circuit board vendors (after over a dozen turned him down) to provide him with the product as needed.</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>I took a quick look at what Joe was purchasing and realized rather quickly that he was ordering all customized boards. I suggested that Joe standardize his outside needs, and customize his product in-house, which would simplify his material purchasing for himself and his vendors as well as cut his material costs with no substantial increase in his manufacturing costs.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Joe readily accepted this suggestion with the comment &#8220;why didn't I ever think of that?&#8221; This is what is known as a &#8220;free bone,&#8221; that is providing something to the client either before you are engaged or in addition to contracted services. This approach also increases your professional credibility and enhances your image.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Business Operations</h2>
<p>He and Flo initially set up the in-house production flow on large second hand wooden tables. When they needed to meet customer delivery commitments, they would have the vendors deliver the boards and at the same time contract with just the number of individuals (i.e., contract employees) to customize the product. Flo would train the production staff; supervise production, packing, and shipping; and bill the customers. Joe was responsible for engineering, purchasing, and vendor relations, and sales and marketing&#8212;working mainly out of his house and car. As Joe and Flo said in those days &#8220;they were one big happy family.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Business Cycle</h2>
<p>As Joe was able to get more business, the business cycle would continue. The first year Joe worked to build the business, and sticking with specialty and custom circuit boards only, had over $3,000,000 in sales with a reported net profit after Joe and Flo's salaries of about $440,000 (a net profit margin of over 13 percent&#8212;not bad for the first year of any business). He and Flo, of course, were working more than they had in their previous jobs. However, they now had one additional ingredient, ownership, and they were building appreciation in their own business.</p>
<h2>Business Growth</h2>
<p>Fairly quickly the word spread that Joe was providing a proprietary quality product at reasonable cost. Joe was now able to bring in more business than his little &#8220;garage shop&#8221; and he and Flo could handle by themselves. With Joe's initial success, he now believed that he had the business acumen to run any business successfully. Nothing builds incompetence greater than success. The company started to grow and grow and grow. During this period, I would see him every so often and he would tell me how well he was doing&#8212;you know in terms of square feet of production and office space, total sales, amount of backlog, number of employees and total payroll, and so on. I cautioned him not to grow too fast and lose control and those elements that had made him successful initially, but he didn't hear. He was becoming just like his previous employer. I asked Joe what he saw as the problems with his company. He started off telling me how well he was doing, again by the numbers. I stopped him and asked him specifically what was the trouble. After hesitating, he finally admitted that he was so successful, it was driving him crazy&#8212;and Flo was in therapy. They had become one big unhappy dysfunctional family.</p>
<h2>The Operational Review Agreement</h2>
<p>After talking with Joe, reviewing his operations, general analysis of the financial statements, review of internal reports and so on; it was agreed that we would review the following functions of the Joe Sorry Company:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Personnel: both manufacturing and general and administrative, as to number and types of personnel necessary.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Manufacturing operations: such as production and inventory control methods and procedures.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Product line analysis: looking at sales, cost, and pricing considerations of the various products.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Profit center concepts: looking at the various businesses such as specialty boards, custom boards, defense business, and basic boards.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Operational reporting considerations: such as key operating indicators (KOI&#39;s), type of reporting, and use of reporting.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Planning and budget systems: including strategic and long term, organization and departmental short-term planning, detail planning, and effective budget techniques.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Proposal or Confirming Letter</h2>
<p>Based on our agreement with Joe, we submitted a proposal or confirming-type letter (see Exhibit 1.4 and Exhibit 1.5 Proposal Letter Budget Estimate for an example) as Joe had already agreed to have us perform the operational review. Note that if you are an internal auditor, it is still suggested that you submit such a document as a letter of understanding to your internal client. Once agreed upon by the client, this becomes your contract.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Chapter 2. Planning Phase</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this chapter, the user should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>discuss the purpose of the planning phase in an operational review,</p>
</li>
<li><p>list information that must be obtained during the planning phase and related sources of information,</p>

</li>
<li><p>describe a sample operational review planning phase work program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>2 A. Introduction</h1>
<p>Planning provides the focus for the future&#8212;not the guarantee of results. Progress requires change; if you never change, you will never progress.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This chapter discusses the planning phase of an operational review. The planning phase is where the reviewer first learns about the organization's operations through various techniques, such as reviewing planning and budget systems, interviewing, reviewing organizational structure and management, gathering and analyzing information, analyzing financial data and statements, inspecting facilities and work procedures, and so forth. Through the performance of these work steps, the reviewer identifies possible critical operational problem areas to be analyzed in more depth in the fieldwork phase, through the development of an operational review work program. In addition, the proper steps to be taken in the planning phase to ensure successful results from an operational review are fully discussed in this chapter.</p>
<h2>Management's Focus</h2>
<h3>1. Purpose</h3>
<p>The starting point for the operational review is management's decision as to which operational area or areas are to be reviewed, and whether the operational review is to be preliminary or in-depth. Based on management's decision, the operational reviewer then starts the planning phase of the operational review. The primary purposes of the planning phase are to do the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Gather information about the operational area</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Identify possible operational problem areas</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Start to develop the basis for the operational review work program</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The major purpose of a preliminary survey is to identify significant areas for improvement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Working Information</h3>
<p>In the planning phase, general working information on all-important aspects of the organization's operations is obtained in a relatively short time. This is usually accomplished on site, at the company's facilities. If this is a first-time review of this company or a new area of review, the reviewer may need to do some additional on-site research and learning, such as reviewing the company's planning and budget systems and its organizational structure and management.</p>
<h3>3. Deficiencies</h3>
<p>It is important to get this information quickly. The information gathering need not be a long drawn-out process, with laborious readings of manuals and other materials. Time-consuming efforts to show the existence of significant deficiencies should not be undertaken. If any indications of serious deficiencies are found, the reviewer should document them so that they will be considered in deciding on areas for additional work. This procedure provides for an orderly approach to the planning phase and directs operational review effort to those areas with the greatest payout in terms of significant improvement.</p>
<h3>4. 80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>Remember the 80/20 rule. Its application in this case states that 20&#160;percent of the problems impact 80 percent of the organization, and 80 percent of the problems impact only 20 percent of the organization. The reviewer is advised to chase the elephants, the 20 percent, and not the mice, the 80 percent.</p>
<h3>5. Objectives and Controls</h3>
<p>At the end of the planning phase, the reviewer should have adequate working knowledge of the objectives and controls of the reviewed area. The reviewer should be familiar with the organization: its objectives, its problems, its physical layout, and the relative significance of the various responsibilities it has been assigned or has assumed. This enables the reviewer to determine at the outset how much time is required to perform the remaining phases of the review.</p>
<h1>2 B. Information to Be Obtained</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>All of the documents gathered during the planning phase are used to start the permanent files for the operational review. The planning phase can be performed efficiently and systematically if the reviewer has a clear idea of what is needed. The records and information that could be required may include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Laws and regulations that apply to the activities being reviewed</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Material on the organization</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Financial information</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Operating methods and procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Management information and reports</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Problem areas</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Laws and Regulations That Apply to the Activities Being Reviewed</h2>
<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>An understanding of the basic legal authorities governing the area and its activities is needed. The satisfactory performance of an operational review requires that the reviewer ascertain the purpose, scope, and objectives of the activities being reviewed, the way those objectives are to be achieved, and the extent of authority and responsibility conferred. In addition to the basic legislation relating to the area, the reviewer needs to obtain information on important laws that apply to the area or activity, including related regulations and legal decisions. For each law, the reviewer should find out the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Its history and background</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The objectives sought</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The authority vested and the responsibilities imposed to achieve the objectives</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The nature of any restrictions imposed</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Any other significant requirements</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>2. Factors</h3>
<p>In operational reviews in which related legislation is a major consideration, the reviewer should be aware of the following factors:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Management may justify certain activities on the basis of general authority contained in basic laws. Whenever general authority is relied on for conducting an activity, the reviewer obtains complete and clear explanations as to such reliance. The reviewer determines and reports on the extent to which such general authority has been used, and makes full disclosure of unused authority, if significant.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Legislation may impose various restrictions on an organization in carrying out an activity. Compliance with these restrictions is a basic responsibility of management. The reviewer should be familiar with the nature of these restrictions and determine specifically how management provides for ensuring compliance.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Material on the Organization</h2>
<p>The second area in which the reviewer needs to gather information involves the organization and its activities. Primary emphasis should be on the activities that are within the scope of the operational review. This information should include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Division of duties and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Principal delegations of authority</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Nature, size, and location of each operational entity (that is, any field offices)</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Number of employees by organization segment and location</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Nature and location of physical assets and accounting records</p>
</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Among the reviewer's primary concerns is to determine how the company is organized to carry out its functions and how duties and responsibilities are assigned. In addition, the reviewer must determine where the area being reviewed fits into the organizational pattern of the whole company and its relationship to other areas. This knowledge is necessary for a full understanding of the organization's operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Financial Information</h2>
<p>The third area of interest to the reviewer is all pertinent financial information, such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Cost of operations by periods</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Year-by-year record of income from revenue-producing operations</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Budget versus actual data for the present and past periods</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Cash flow analysis</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Cost accounting data</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Operating Methods and Procedures</h2>
<p>Normally, the reviewer is more concerned with operating data than with the data typically in a financial statement. A fourth area is investigated to obtain a general description of the organization's operating methods and procedures. The reviewer analyzes and documents the operating methods and procedures by which activities being reviewed are performed. In the planning phase, the reviewer should obtain information as to the general methods and procedures top management prescribes for operating in the area under consideration. In this phase, the review of methods and procedures should not extend below the management level. If it is necessary to get accurate information on which to base a conclusion of how certain systems and procedures actually work, the reviewer may want to talk with a limited number of operations personnel. The information obtained may be generalized and may require further development later in the review to determine the precise methods and procedures at the operating level.</p>
<h2>Management Information and Reports</h2>
<p>A fifth category of interest is management information and reports. The reviewer should identify all available management information as well as the nature, content, and timing of all reporting. The reviewer should also look for management information that should be present, but is not. It is extremely important to identify the key operating indicators that management has singled out for reporting purposes and those items subject to exception reporting.</p>
<h2>Problem Areas</h2>
<p>Finally, the reviewer gathers information regarding any problem areas. The reviewer identifies and documents all important problem areas relative to the activities to be reviewed. Areas of major deficiency and those that lend themselves to the greatest improvements are to be emphasized. Remember, these are the items to be pursued in the work program and fieldwork phases. To spend review time most efficiently, it is important to analyze those operational areas with the largest potential payout in terms of improvements. Again, the organization's &#8220;elephants&#8221; should be identified in terms of present problem areas, and the &#8220;mice&#8221; considered only for in-house correction.</p>
<h1>2 C. Sources of Planning Information</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>What are the sources of information to be gathered in the planning phase? Such information could come from various sources; however, the following are the most usual:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Effective interviewing</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Organizational data</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Financial data</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Operating and management reports</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Physical inspection</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Effective Interviewing</h2>
<p>One of the major sources of information about the organization's activities, procedures, and systems is an effective interview. The purpose of the interview is to find out what is going on and why. Interviews in the planning phase should normally be limited to management, to obtain an overview of the operations without becoming involved in the time-consuming details of interviewing the technical personnel more directly engaged in the operation. In practice, limited interviews with operations personnel are usually conducted to ensure that a full and accurate picture is obtained.</p>
<h2>Organizational Data</h2>
<p>Organizational data may include such things as copies of organization charts, functional job descriptions, and position charts. The reviewer should be sure to ascertain actual duties, responsibilities, and levels of authority for each individual. Written job descriptions should not be automatically accepted at face value. This could entail talking to selected management and operations personnel and/or having them prepare a description of their perceived job duties and responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Financial Data</h2>
<p>Another source of planning phase information is financial data, such as financial statements over a number of years, budget versus actual reports (present and past), cost of operations by period, revenues year by year by source, cash flow analysis, cost accounting data, and ratio, change, and trend analysis.</p>
<h2>Policies and Procedures</h2>
<p>Existing policies and procedures, which should be documented in procedures manuals, policy pronouncements, directives, and regulations, are yet another source of information. For many small organizations, such materials will probably not exist, except in the heads of management personnel. In this case, the reviewer would then interview these persons to determine what they believe to be existing policies and procedures, and then test them to determine whether they are actually being followed.</p>
<h2>Operating and Management Reports</h2>
<p>Further sources of information are operations and management reports, submitted either internally or externally, prior and related review and audit reports and workpapers, and, if available, internal audit and review reports. The reviewer would also determine whether management has responded to any findings identified in these reports and whether any action has been taken.</p>
<h2>Physical Inspection</h2>
<p>Finally, the reviewer makes a physical inspection of the operation, including a tour of all pertinent operational areas and the observation of significant activities being performed. A physical review of the operations area, whenever appropriate, is made relative to the nature of the activities to be examined. The purpose of this physical review is to improve understanding of the activity in physical terms, and to provide support for information about the activity obtained during interviews.</p>
<h1>2 D. Understanding the Organization</h1>
<h2>Review of Organizational Planning and Budget Systems</h2>
<p>A good starting point for the reviewer in the planning phase is to understand the organization, why it is in existence, and what it is trying to accomplish (i.e., its goals and objectives). To accomplish this, the reviewer needs to understand the organization's long-term and short-term planning methods and related budgeting and control processes. The reviewer should focus on the organization's approach to planning and its integration with the budgeting process. The organization's planning and budgeting techniques should be a means of achieving improved organizational effectiveness. The reviewer should also be aware of the elements of an effective planning/budgeting system to compare to the practices of the organization under review.</p>
<h2>Strategic Planning</h2>
<p>There should be interaction and interdependence of the strategic (long-term) planning, short-term planning, detail planning, budgeting and monitoring processes. The planning process should be an essential first step in the preparation of an effective budget for the organization. By learning effective planning and budgeting procedures, the reviewer will be able to more effectively review and analyze such procedures as part of her/his organization-wide, departmental, or specific function operational review.</p>
<h2>Organizational Structure and Role of Management</h2>
<p>Theoretically, organizations are put together so that the entity can conduct its business more efficiently, and so that the owners and/or top management can multiply their effectiveness (i.e., maximize their desired results). Organizing is intended to be a helping process to enable us to conduct our business better. For many organizations it has become a costly getting-in-the-way process. As part of the planning phase, the operational reviewer must ascertain whether the organization is properly organized or whether improper organization is the cause of its problems.</p>
<h3>1. Organizational Controls</h3>
<p>Adequate organizational control requires that each employee know clearly what her/his role and function is in the organization, and exactly what authority and responsibility have been assigned. It also requires proper separation of duties so that the same individual is not charged with the responsibility for recording and reporting on how a particular task has been accomplished.</p>
<h3>2. Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>Why do organizations in the private and public sectors place more emphasis on the organizational structure of their operations? The answer, in most cases, is because that is how it has always been. If some people were not reporting to other people, they would not know what to do. How could anybody trust them to do their jobs without someone else to watch them? It has become standard procedure to departmentalize people without maintaining individual accountability. When there is trouble within the organization, it is simple to get rid of the entire department or the departmental scapegoat or troublemaker (normally the one who asks the right questions when nobody has good answers), and avoid facing the real cause of the problem. Many times the real problem is ineffective top management. Rather than admit to that, lower-level employees are blamed and let go.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Operational reviews are not designed to eliminate specific employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness</h3>
<p>The real answer why organizations should organize is so that they can accomplish their desired results (be most effective) in the most economical manner (optimum use of limited resources) using the best available methods of operations (be most efficient). This is, of course, the three E&#39;s of operational reviews: economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. If we were able to accomplish the goals of the three E&#39;s (economy, efficiency, and effectiveness) in the first place, and keep things that way, we would not need the quick fixes. Rather than admit our mistakes and make the necessary corrections (i.e., do the right thing), we blame others.</p>
<h3>4. Organizational Structure Examples</h3>
<p>Representative top-level organization charts are shown in Exhibits&#160;2.1 and 2.2. This typical structure would fit most organizations. It is based on hierarchical pyramid concepts where the ultimate power starts at the top and is delegated down through the pyramid. This is a military model. Its purpose is to maintain control within the organization through a chain of command that demands obedience from each level of the organization that reports to a higher level. To this day, many organizations still function in this manner, where the purpose for the organizational hierarchy is to police and control those reporting to them to make sure they do their jobs.</p>
<p><b>(A). Policing and Control</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The structure is also set up with the intrinsic message that those in a higher position on the chart know more. Hence, much of their time is spent on reviewing the work of those under them and then having those under them redo it so it looks more like what the manager would do. It is these policing-and-control-review-and-redo processes that make many supervisors and managers superfluous (non-value added) organizational overhead, and often more hindrance than help.</p>
<p><b>(B). Self-Disciplined Employees</b> &#160;</p>
<p>If these non-value-added processes are eliminated, management is strictly limited to necessities, and the organization creates an atmosphere that encourages the motivation of self-disciplined employee behavior, we can eliminate many of these layers of unnecessary organization.</p>

<h3>5. Areas to Review</h3>

<h3>2. Tools</h3>
<p>We use various operational review tools to assist in gathering and analyzing information about the organization. Sample tools include the initial survey form discussed previously and a Job Responsibilities Questionnaire to be filled in by each employee as shown in Exhibit&#160;2.3. Both of these tools are examples of user- or client-provided data, which is to be encouraged, as this minimizes the data gathering time of the operational review team.</p>
<p>Exhibit 2.3&#8212; Job Responsibilities Questionnaire (is available as pdf supplement through this link and Tools).</p>
<h1>2 E. Identification of Critical Problem Areas</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>1. Critical Areas</h3>
<p>Now that needed information has been obtained, how should it be used? The planning data gathered provide the background and general working information for the operational review staff. It should also be used to help decide which specific areas of activity to examine in the fieldwork phase. In most operational reviews, the review staff decides which specific areas to review. The general objective is to direct attention to those matters that most urgently need it. Identifying these critical areas is an important component of each operational review.</p>
<h3>2. Techniques to Identify Critical Problem Areas</h3>
<p>Techniques for preliminary identification of critical problem areas vary with the type of engagement. They require a reviewer's ingenuity and judgment. Such techniques include the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Identification of key activities</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Use of management reports</p>
</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Examination of past review and audit reports</p>
</td>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Physical inspection of the activities</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Discussions with responsible personnel</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Identification of Key Activities</h2>
<p>The information obtained may disclose key activities or aspects of an activity that appear to be difficult to control or susceptible to abuse or laxity. For instance, in a purchasing operation, the key critical areas might well be the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Determinations of quantities and qualities to be purchased</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Methods used in obtaining the most advantageous price</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Methods of determining whether the correct quantities and qualities are actually received</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Use of Management Reports</h2>
<p>Examining the reports management uses to assure itself that work is progressing within established time and cost goals should provide valuable information in selecting areas of inquiry. Examples of such reporting is operational exception reporting and actual versus plan reporting, which would compare actual results with goals and objectives. The reviewer should look closely at those items management has selected as critical for exception reporting, such as inventory levels, productivity measures, sales analysis, and so on. Indications of critical area to look at will surface if major deviancies are found between the plan and actual results. Keep in mind that the plan could be all right and the operational results critical, or vice versa.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Where such reports are not being used effectively, the reviewer should inquire as to the methods by which control is exercised. This inquiry may point to a lack of effective control with related administrative weakness. It may disclose other less formal control procedures, which may, in turn, disclose operational weaknesses. Similar considerations would apply if proper performance yardsticks have not been established.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Examination of Past Review and Audit Reports</h2>
<p>Past review and audit reports (internal and external) may be a valuable source of information in determining direction of effort. There should be an examination not only of reports prepared by the internal or external review or audit groups, but also of those of other internal review organizations, as well as supervisory groups, where applicable, such as bank examiners. The reviewer should determine whether management agrees with specific review or audit findings, particularly if mentioned by more than one review or audit group, and whether any action has been taken to correct the situation.</p>
<h2>Physical Inspection of the Activities</h2>
<p>A physical inspection of activities requires alertness for signs of ineffectiveness or inefficiency, such as bottlenecks, excess accumulations of equipment or material, and idleness of personnel. Such inspections may disclose serious weaknesses warranting inquiry, or they may depict a pattern prevalent throughout the organization.</p>
<h2>Discussions With Responsible Personnel</h2>
<p>Finally, discussions with responsible officials and personnel directly concerned with the activity may assist in the identification of critical areas. Sometimes, valuable leads can be obtained through discussions with responsible officials and others directly concerned with the activities performed. These individuals can often identify troublesome areas or request that the reviewer look into specific matters that they are concerned about, but for which they lack information regarding the actual conditions.</p>
<h1>2 F. Review of Administrative and Operational Controls</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Certain key areas are part of the operational reviewer's review of internal administrative and operational controls in the planning phase. These include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Organization</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Accounting and other records</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Performance standards</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Information systems and internal reports</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Adequate organizational control requires that each employee know clearly what her/his role and function is in the organization, and exactly what authority and responsibility have been assigned. It also requires proper separation of duties so that the same individual is not responsible for recording and reporting on how a particular task has been accomplished.</p>
<h2>Policies and Procedures</h2>
<p>Policy sets forth the organization's operating guidelines and specifies what is required, and procedures outline how the policies will be carried out.</p>
<h2>Accounting and Other Records</h2>
<p>The results of business operations must be recorded promptly, accurately, completely, and in conformity with both operating responsibilities and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Accounting and other records must accurately reflect the financial condition of the organization and provide the means for making future business decisions, based on past results.</p>
<h2>Performance Standards</h2>
<p>Performance standards are used to measure results and highlight conditions or trends for management's actions. The reviewer determines the existence and appropriateness of any performance standard established and what actions have been taken.</p>
<h2>Information Systems and Internal Reports</h2>
<p>Major tools in the management control process are information systems and internal reports. They must be economically viable, timely, accurate, concise, and complete. They must provide adequate control over the organization's resources, revenues, and expenditures. That is why appraisal of the effectiveness of internal reports and communications is so important.</p>
<h3>1. Factors</h3>
<p>The task of appraising the effectiveness of internal reports involves determination of the following three factors:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The purpose of the report or the primary communication management intends the report to perform (the intended function)</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The way in which the report affects employees (the actual function)</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The correlation or degree of correspondence between the report's intended effect and the actual effect on the function</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>2. Function</h3>
<p>The reviewer's task is to determine that the intended function and the actual function (how the report's recipient perceives her/his function) are the same. If they are not the same, there is a lack of effective communication. If, on the other hand, such reports are not used, inquiry can be made as to the methods by which control is exercised, which may point to a lack of effective control, with related laxity and administrative weakness.</p>
<h1>2 G. Financial Statement Analysis</h1>
<h2>Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Because members of the operational review team usually have some financial expertise, a good place to start in determining critical operational areas is to analyze the organization's financial data and statements. Keep in mind that financial statements, produced from a financial accounting standpoint, are essentially historical documents that present the organization's assets, liabilities, and equity in a balance sheet and its revenues and expenses in an income statement. These financial statements tell what has happened within the organization during a particular period or series of periods. These same financial statements can be used from an operational review standpoint to help identify present and future critical areas for review. The use of certain analytical tools can effectively help to analyze the financial statements, determine how the organization is doing, and zero in on critical areas that need attention and improvement.</p>
<h2>Comparisons</h2>
<p>Financial statements are primarily static historical documents showing data related only to a specific period of time. Operational reviewers are concerned with the period being reported, and what the trend of events has been and will be over longer periods of time. Accordingly, comparing financial statement data with the results of other periods, or of other organizations, provides a better understanding of trends and helps in making proper decisions as to their relative significance. Comparisons can be made with the historical performance of the company, a competitor's performance, performance of other organizations within the same industry, and organizational goals, objectives, and detail plans.</p>
<h3>1. Benchmarking</h3>
<p>Comparison within the same organization is also known as internal benchmarking, which looks for best results and related best practices. Comparison outside of an organization (competitors, industry, and best in class) is also known as external benchmarking, which looks for best practices that can be incorporated into operations in a program of continuous improvement.</p>
<h3>2. Consistency</h3>
<p>In making comparisons, it is important to be reasonably sure that the data are comparable; that is, that they are calculated on a consistent basis between or among years, companies, and so on. If not, incorrect or misleading conclusions may be drawn, resulting in the expenditure of a substantial amount of operational review time on the wrong functional area.</p>
<h3>3. Formatting</h3>
<p>An initial analytical procedure in financial statement analysis is to format the company's statements comparatively. This may entail comparing this year with last year or comparing a number of years&#39; data, arriving at numerical and/or percentage differences. Preparing statements in such comparative form can disclose valuable information as to present conditions and what to expect about future financial and operating performance.</p>
<h3>4. Horizontal Analysis</h3>
<p>Comparison of two or more years&#39; data is known as horizontal analysis, which identifies changes over time by displaying data changes from year to year in both dollars and percentages. Dollar changes help to identify key factors having an impact on future operations, financial position, or profitability. The Example Company's comparative financial statements for the last three years are shown in Exhibit 2.4. These statements should be reviewed and then the possible critical areas of the Example Company's operations to be considered for operational review should be listed.</p>
<h3>5. Percentage Change</h3>
<p>Looking at changes in percentage between years also assists in providing proper perspective as to changes. For example, a different conclusion is reached when sales increase by $2 million over a previous year's sales of $4 million (a significant increase of 50 percent), than when the previous year's sales were $100 million (an increase of only 2 percent).</p>
<h3>6. Balance Sheet and Income Statement Review</h3>
<p>In the Example Company's Comparative Balance Sheets, there are other examples where the combination of dollar and percentage changes provide a more complete analysis and help to determine a future trouble spot. For instance, an accounts receivable increase from $1,600 in XXX8 to $1,900 in XXX9 does not appear too critical; however, expressed as an 18-percent increase (and as 7 percent of sales of $12,500), it takes on greater significance. As seen in the Example Company's Comparative Income Statements, sales increased by $500,000 from XXX7 to XXX8; however, cost of goods sold also increased by $500,000 exactly offsetting the change in sales and adding nothing to profitability.</p>

<h3>2. Trend Percentages</h3>
<p>Financial statement analysis can also be accomplished through the use of trend percentages, which are used to state a number of years&#39; financial data in terms of a base year. The rule in using trend percentages is that at least three data points need to be examined before a trend can be identified.</p>
<p><b>Example 2.1&#8212;Trend Percentages</b> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Consider the Example Company:</i> &#160;</p>
<div style="margin-top:14px;">
<table class="lt" width="400">
<tr>
    <th align="center">&#160;</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;XXX9</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;XXX8</th>
    <th align="right">XXX7</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sales</td>
    <td align="right">$12,500</td>
    <td align="right">$11,000</td>
    <td align="right">$10,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Net Income</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;1,200</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;900</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;900</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p><i>Analyzing the dollar data alone, it could be concluded that both sales and net income have increased over the three-year period. However, it cannot readily be concluded how fast sales have increased and whether the increases in net income have kept pace with sales increases. Using dollar data alone may make it difficult to conclude adequately. Now, assume that the base year XXX7 is equal to 100 percent; the other years can be stated as a percentage of the base year:</i> &#160;</p>
<div style="margin-top:14px;">
<table class="lt" width="550">
<tr>
    <th align="center">&#160;</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;&#160;XXX9</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;&#160;XXX8</th>
    <th align="right">XXX7</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&#160;</td>
    <td align="right">Dollars%</td>
    <td align="right">Dollars%</td>
    <td align="right">Dollars%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sales</td>
    <td align="right">$12,500119%</td>
    <td align="right">$11,000105%</td>
    <td align="right">$10,500100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Net Income</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;1,200133%</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;900100%</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;900100%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p><i>By using these trend percentages as well as the differences in real dollars (or numbers), the increase in sales and net income can be put into proper perspective. It can now be clearly seen that the relative growth in sales has been surpassed by the growth in net income; sales in XXX9 are 19 percent greater than the base year, but net income is 33 percent greater. Note also that sales growth was better than net income growth in XXX8, and that the growth in sales in XXX9 over XXX8 was considerably below the growth in net income for the same year. Such an analysis could indicate major operational areas for review, such as sales analysis, cost of goods sold analysis, selling price procedures, and cost analysis.</i> &#160;</p>
<h3>3. Common-Size Statements</h3>
<p>A common-size financial statement shows the line items as percentages in addition to absolute dollars. Each line item on the financial statements is shown as a percentage of some total, such as assets or sales. The preparation and presentation of common-size statements is known as &#8220;vertical analysis,&#8221; revealing changes in the relative significance of each line item. An analysis of financial statements on a common-size basis could disclose such areas as shown in Example 2.2.</p>

<p><i>Comments: The switch between labor and material indicates a major change from in-house manufacturing to outside sourcing of parts, or some other significant change in product. The drop in G&amp;A expenses is also significant, but may be the result of increasing volume. Other changes are not material. The change away from in-house manufacturing when related to the investment in property, plant and equipment raises a disturbing conflict that needs to be explained.</i> &#160;</p>
<h3>4. Financial Ratios</h3>

By analyzing changes, inconsistencies, and trends using ratios, and comparisons between time periods of various accounts (such as inventory, sales, expenses, etc.), they can also provide advice and insight into the client's operations as well as indicate where the most critical problems might lie. These ratios should be analyzed in combination as well as related to specific operations.</p>

<h2>Identifying Critical Areas</h2>
<p>As a result of the initial survey and analysis of financial statement data of the Example Company, the operational reviewer is able to help management identify its critical operational areas where operational review procedures would provide the most benefits. This step is not always required, as quite often management has already decided which areas would provide the biggest payout by an operational review.</p>
<h3>1. Potential Areas for Improvement</h3>
<p>Based on the reviewer's analysis of the Example Company financial statements, a list of potential areas for operational review were developed as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>

<h3>2. Priority Areas for Improvement</h3>
<p>Although all of the operational areas recommended for operational review should produce beneficial results and adequate payout, the Example Company's management has decided to review the purchasing function first. Their rationale is that purchasing is responsible for the economy of operations related to additions to inventory; manufacturing material costs; additions to property, plant and equipment; expediting on-time vendor deliveries; and overall vendor relations. Because the Example Company has become increasingly material dependent in its manufacturing operations, with resultant increases in inventory, this does appear to be a good place to start. In addition, the initial survey disclosed that the purchasing department systems and procedures were antiquated and quite ineffective.</p>
<h2>Areas Not Selected for Review</h2>
<p>The other operational areas for which it is determined that additional operational review work will not be performed at this time are not to be merely put aside. They should all be mentioned to organizational and departmental management in an oral and/or written report, recommending further action, such as the following:</p>
<h3>1. Immediate Action</h3>
<p>For example, facility changes to be made so that buyers have privacy when talking with vendors and a set schedule established for vendor appointments</p>
<h3>2. Further Analysis and Review by Organizational and Departmental Management</h3>
<p>For example, management might consider changing the purchasing department reporting to the Vice President of Operations, as well as other conflicting units such as inspections, inventory control, and warehouse</p>
<h3>3. Future Operational Review by Operational Review Team or Internal Departmental Personnel</h3>
<p>For example, the review of special approval procedures, such as capital expenditures, over budget limitations, and special projects</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a result of the work steps conducted in the planning phase as described above, a properly indexed and organized planning phase workpaper file should have been developed for all the materials gathered and work steps performed. The workpaper file is used as a resource in developing the indepth work program and the corresponding fieldwork. A number of critical operating areas should also have been developed where more in-depth review procedures need to be performed in the work program phase leading toward development of a significant operational review finding.</p>
<h3>1. Example Areas</h3>
<p>For example, the following areas may have been identified for more in-depth analysis from the planning phase as described in this section.</p>

<h3>2. Work Program</h3>
<p>The in-depth operational review work program should also have been started. Based on the identification of possible critical operational areas, each member on the review team should have begun thinking about and have documented suggested work steps to be incorporated into the in-depth work program. This is the starting point for developing the operational review work program. The steps required for its finalization are discussed in Chapter 3. Before continuing, review the operational review situation &#8220;Purchase Order Quantity Tolerances&#8221; (Example 2.3) as an example of what you might encounter in the planning phase.</p>
<p><b>Example 2.3&#8212;Purchase Order Quantity Tolerances</b> &#160;</p>
<p><i>During the planning phase of an operational review, the reviewer found in reviewing the Purchasing Department's methods and procedures that vendors could be allowed to ship the ordered quantity plus or minus 10 percent. However, this practice was approved only for certain commodities such as nuts, bolts, wire, and rope.</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>During physical inspection of the Purchasing Department and discussions with the manager of the Purchasing Department as part of the planning phase of the operational review, the reviewer found that:</i> &#160;</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The 10-percent quantity tolerance was being used for items that didn't require a tolerance, such as office supplies, maintenance items, cleaning supplies, etc.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Most vendors took advantage of the tolerance terms and shipped the ordered quantity plus 10 percent.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Procedures existed relative to such purchase order tolerances; however, each buyer decided what was appropriate based on knowledge of industry practice.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><b><i>Questions and Solutions for Consideration:</i></b> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Q. What additional steps might the reviewer want to perform in the planning phase relative to this situation?</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>A. Time-consuming efforts to show the existence of significant deficiencies should not be undertaken. Accordingly, this situation should only be documented at this point, for consideration when deciding on areas for additional work.</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Q. What could the reviewer suggest, if anything, to the Purchasing Department to correct the situation at this point?</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>A. Written instructions should be prepared for each buyer stating the specific items that require tolerance and the level of tolerance to be used.</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Note that the institution of such written instructions, and exercise of granting such purchase tolerances only to those items requiring it, resulted in a net annual savings of approximately $320,000 for the Example Company.</i> &#160;</p>
<h1>2 I. Case Study: Joe Sorry, Inc.</h1>
<h2>Areas to Be Reviewed</h2>
<p>The starting point for the operational review of Joe Sorry, Inc. is Joe and Flo's decision as to which operational area or areas to be reviewed. As was discussed and documented in the proposal letter, the general areas to be reviewed were agreed to be the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Personnel: manufacturing, general, and administrative</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Manufacturing operations</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Product line analysis</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Profit center concepts</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Operational reporting considerations</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Planning and budget systems</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Organization Review</h2>
<p>The original organization for Joe Sorry, Inc. was primarily Joe and Flo with contract labor hired as needed. The organization structure while simple exemplifies many of the principles of proper organization such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Clear lines of authority</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Proper division of duties and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Communication between functions, across functions, upward, and downward</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Minimal use of personnel and then only as needed</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Proper delegation of responsibility and authority</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Management able to effectively control the sphere of their operations and results</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Management and other personnel clearly understanding what is expected of them and the results to be achieved</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>Organization established based on the principles of the three E&#39;s&#8212;economy, efficiency, and effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li value="9"><p>The right size organization for what needs to be accomplished</p>
</li>
<li value="10"><p>Minimal levels of non-value added employees and management</p>
</li>
<li value="11"><p>Organization no larger than it has to be to accomplish results</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Tour of Facilities</h2>
<p>The first thing I did upon arriving to conduct the planning phase of the operational review at Joe's business, which was now located in a fancy new industrial park in an upward mobile suburban area, was to take a tour of his operations. Joe took me around, proud of what he had accomplished&#8212;over 10,000 square feet of production space with 50 production employees, and 3,000 feet of office space with over 30 employees. I asked Joe to leave and let me mosey around the facilities, while he returned to the crisis of the day. The following is what I found out by walking around and talking with the employees on my own:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The 50 production employees were separated into 6 teams of seven employees each, with one team member assigned the role of team leader. Although the team leader received a minimal amount of additional pay, not one of them was comfortable exercising their team leader responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Each of the 6 teams was assigned a foreperson, who was responsible for pushing and maximizing production. Only one of the forepersons was &#8220;respected&#8221; by her team, and that was only because she left them alone to do their jobs.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>The production teams were divided into 4 groups by type of product. Joe had increased from strictly a producer of specialty boards to a diversified product line as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Specialty boards for a constant customer base: 1 team</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Custom boards as requested by customers: 1 team</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Defense contractors on a contract basis: 2 teams</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Basic boards on a competitive basis to any and all customers: 2 teams. These basic boards were purchased from an offshore producer, and Joe's employees checked them, provided add-ons, and Joe's identification materials.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The other two production employees were a Vice-President of Production responsible for Production Control and Scheduling and an Inventory Control Manager responsible for ensuring that sufficient materials were on-hand to meet production needs. Idle teams due to material stock-outs were forbidden.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(F)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>In addition, I found that there were also 12 additional employees that Joe considered indirect labor or overhead (neither plant nor office). These included the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Five repair and maintenance employees who were responsible for maintaining equipment and cleaning the facilities in the plant and office&#8212;who appeared to be doing mainly &#8220;busy work.&#8221;</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(2)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Four packers and shippers, and three receivers. Both units appeared to work sporadically, and at other times got in the way of the production people.</p>
</td>
  </tr>

</li>
</ol><h2>Review of the Office Functions</h2>
<p>When I went to find Joe, he was in the midst of his next crisis, so I wandered around the office area and talked with those personnel I was able to catch in their offices. The following is what I found out on my quick review tour of the office area:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The office and its 30 employees was divided into the following functions:</p>

<li value="2"><p>Every employee in the office had a computer networked into a central file server. Other than the above functions, I found three other PCs in the office area&#8212;two for word processing and one for a spreadsheet application.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Other Functions Using Office Space</h2>
<p>In addition I found the following functions, not included as production or office, but occupying office space:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Quality Control (really a production function, but housed in the office area): 7 employees; a QC Manager and 6 QC inspectors&#8212;one assigned to each production team (whether they needed it or not).</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Customer Service: 3 employees; a manager and two others; who spent their day dealing with customer calls and complaints&#8212;mainly late deliveries and after sale issues.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Personnel: 2 employees: a Personnel Manager and one assistant.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Joe's Office: which included himself as President/CFO and 3 Assistants to the President (who turned out to be troubleshooters for the crises that Joe could not handle).</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Vice-President's Office: for Flo (who rarely appeared) and two assistants. Formal title: Vice President of Operations.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Clerical Staff: 24 employees; 4 each for sales and accounting, 3 each for engineering and purchasing, 2 each for customer service, personnel, and quality control, 1 each for Joe and Flo, plus 2 receptionists.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Review of Organization and Employees</h2>
<p>Instead of the 80 or so employees Joe had claimed, there were actually over 130 (not including Joe and Flo), with as many office personnel controlling and supporting production operations. It was apparent that Joe had created a corporate empire, almost rivaling his former employer. I compared the original organization for Joe's initial &#8220;garage shop&#8221; business to the one I prepared for the present organization. The differences were not only staggering, but also Joe and the company were out of control. Joe's organization chart now looked like a camel (that is, a horse created by a committee). The organization had grown based on immediate crisis rather than on proper organizational principles. Quick review and analysis of the current organization showed some possible inefficiencies and organizational roadblocks, such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Instead of Joe and Flo handling all of the major functions, they now had 135 employees.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Gross payroll was now over $3,010,000. Compared to the present level of $6,250,000 in gross sales, this represents over 48 percent of sales. Even at this relatively high level, the company was able to earn $830,000 or 13.3 percent of sales.</p>

</ol><h2>Analysis of Initial Survey Form</h2>
<p>One of the first steps in the planning phase is to analyze the organization's responses to an initial survey form, such as the one shown in Exhibit 2.5.</p>
<p>Exhibit 2.5 Operational Review Initial Survey Form is available as a pdf supplement through this link and Tools.</p>
<h3>1. Planning and Budgeting</h3>
<p>There are no real planning systems in place. The only defined goal is to be the biggest possible in terms of sales and income, which may create a conflict. In the absence of effective planning systems, the budget system does not integrate with the company's plans, but is merely a broad projection for the next year (based on Joe's wishes rather than any reality) compared on a monthly basis by the controller.</p>
<h3>2. Personnel and Staffing</h3>
<p>The organization is growing out of control. It appears that there are too many employees in almost every function, with a good possibility that instead of providing increased efficiency, they often get in everyone else's way. Many employees do not seem to know exactly what they should be doing; there is possibly more filling of time than achievement of desired results. Personnel hiring, orientation, training, supervision, evaluation, promotion, and firing practices have to be reviewed and greatly improved; there is too much control by Joe and the department managers.</p>
<h3>3. Management</h3>
<p>Top management is really Joe&#8212;not effectively delegating. Flo has almost disappeared from the operations of the company. The Production Manager, although given authority over production, is continually being overridden by Joe. Middle management appears to be operating under similar conditions&#8212;that is, controlled by Joe. An effective management and operating reporting system does not exist. There is a need for delegating down to the lowest possible levels and keeping Joe from interfering with everyone's operations.</p>
<h3>4. Policies and Procedures</h3>
<p>No formal policies or procedures exist. This is causing great confusion overall within the organization and within most of the departments. There is too much control by management, with capricious changes by management making it difficult for employees to sense any consistency.</p>
<h3>5. Computer Processing</h3>
<p>There are personal computers in every department, one in almost every employee's workstation. Many are not being used at all; some are used minimally, others are used for packaged software applications. This area needs to be reviewed and analyzed to determine how an effective management and operating reporting system can be implemented.</p>
<h3>6. Manufacturing Systems</h3>
<p>Although there is a computerized manufacturing system for production and inventory control, it appears that it is being used ineffectively, mainly for routing customer orders through production and reporting inventory reorders (based on reorder points and reorder quantities) and on-hand inventory balances. The software is used to support ineffective manufacturing processes.</p>
<h3>7. Responsibility and Authority</h3>
<p>Responsibilities have not been clearly defined, so most employees do not know what they should be doing and what is expected of them. Although authority has been somewhat delegated to middle managers, Joe through his continual interference has sabotaged it.</p>
<h2>Identification of Critical Areas for Review</h2>
<p>A good method to use in identifying critical areas for review is to have the review team staff record each possible area as they work through the preliminary survey and the planning phase. At the end of the planning phase, the review team members critique the list accumulated and combine like items, eliminate unnecessary or less critical items, and then prioritize the remaining items. The review team's list of critical areas for review is shown in Exhibit 2.6.</p>

<h1>Glossary for "Test01: Level 1"</h1>
<hr id="bk809401"/>
<h1>80/20 rule</h1>
<p>Belief that 20 percent of the problems impact 80 percent of the organization, and 80 percent of the problems impact only 20 percent of the organization.</p>
<hr id="bk809402"/>
<h1>Basic business principles</h1>
<p>Principles determined by a company to guide its operations. These principles become the foundation on which the company bases its desirable operational practices. It is these basic business principles that must be considered in analyzing the company&#39;s operations during the conduct of the operational review.</p>
<hr id="bk809403"/>
<h1>Benchmarking</h1>
<p>Comparison of outputs or processes.  Comparison within the same organization is also known as internal benchmarking, which looks for best results and related best practices.  Comparison outside of an organization (competitors, industry, and best in class) is also known as external benchmarking, which looks for best practices that can be incorporated into operations in a program of continuous improvement.</p>
<hr id="bk809404"/>
<h1>Cash Conversion Business</h1>
<p>Business that creates desired goods and services so that the investment in the business is as quickly converted to cash as possible, with the resultant cash-in exceeding the cash-out (net profits or positive return on investment). The correlating philosophy to this goal can be stated as follows: &#8220;To achieve desired business results using the most efficient methods so that the organization can optimize the use of limited resources.&#8221;</p>
<hr id="bk809405"/>
<h1>Consistency</h1>
<p>In making comparisons, it is important to be reasonably sure that the data are comparable; that is, that they are calculated on a consistent basis between or among years, companies, and so on.  If not, incorrect or misleading conclusions may be drawn, resulting in the expenditure of a substantial amount of operational review time on the wrong functional area.</p>
<hr id="bk809407"/>
<h1>Deficiencies</h1>
<p>Matters worthy of attention that represent a potential or real shortcoming in some aspect that has the potential to adversely affect the ability of the entity to achieve its objectives.</p>
<hr id="bk8094012"/>
<h1>Evidence</h1>
<p>Matter that should be considered in the operational review and includes the following types: physical observations, photos, slides, etc.; testimonial interviews, personal statements, etc.; documentary letters, contracts, grants, records, etc.; and analytical an analysis of information.</p>
<hr id="bk8094013"/>
<h1>Fieldwork phase</h1>
<p>Period in which work steps are performed, as defined in the work program phase.  The purpose of the fieldwork phase is to determine whether all functions and activities included in the review are being performed economically, efficiently, and effectively.</p>
<hr id="bk8094015"/>
<h1>Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</h1>
<p>Common set of accounting principles, authoritative standards, and procedures set by recognized policy boards that organizations use to compile their financial statements.</p>
<hr id="bk8094016"/>
<h1>Horizontal analysis</h1>
<p>A comparison of two or more years' data which identifies changes over time by displaying data changes from year to year in both dollars and percentages. Dollar changes help to identify key factors having an impact on future operations, financial position, or profitability. Looking at changes in percentage between years also assists in providing proper perspective as to changes.</p>
<hr id="bk8094018"/>
<h1>Interviewing</h1>
<p>Process generally limited to management, along with some interviewing of operations personnel, in the planning phase.  In the fieldwork phase, interviews are not limited to management, but primarily include those employees who actually do the work so as to determine what is going on and why.</p>
<hr id="bk8094021"/>
<h1>Operational review</h1>
<p>A widely used term encompassing many aspects and techniques; however, no uniform, commonly recognized definition has been unanimously accepted.  Combining definitions, it could be said that an operational review is a review of operations performed from a management viewpoint to evaluate the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of any and all operations, limited only by management's desires.  It is a process for analyzing internal operations and activities to identify areas for positive improvement in a program of continuous improvement.</p>
<hr id="bk8094023"/>
<h1>Operational review triangle</h1>
<p>The three Es of operational review: economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.</p>
<hr id="bk8094024"/>
<h1>Operational reviewer</h1>
<p>Anyone with the appropriate skills that performs an operational review; however, internal and/or external consultants, because of their knowledge of the operations and their analytical skills, are typically requested to perform such services.  In some organizations, a separate operational review unit trained in operational review concepts is established.  Operational reviewers use their skills and abilities to assess a user's situations and recommend positive operational improvements.</p>
<hr id="bk8094027"/>
<h1>Planning phase</h1>
<p>Period in which the operational reviewer first learns about the organization's operations through various techniques, such as reviewing planning and budget systems, interviewing, reviewing organizational structure and management, gathering and analyzing information, analyzing financial data and statements, inspecting facilities and work procedures, and so forth.</p>
<hr id="bk8094028"/>
<h1>Ratio, change, and trend analysis</h1>
<p>Technique used in the fieldwork phase to strengthen and supplement other operational review tools and procedures.  Using this technique, the reviewer critically examines, interprets, and explains relationships between sets of operating and financial data at a given point in time by comparing them over a number of periods.  Ratios have no intrinsic significance; they are primarily useful in highlighting significant changes and relationships.</p>
<hr id="bk8094031"/>
<h1>Review phases</h1>
<p>Phases that consist of planning, work programs, fieldwork, development of findings and recommendations, and reporting.</p>
<hr id="bk8094035"/>
<h1>Work program phase</h1>
<p>Period of review of selected activities as determined in the planning phase.  It becomes the bridge between the planning phase and the fieldwork phase.  It is in the work program phase that the operational reviewer focuses on the significant operational areas identified in the planning phase and develops specific work steps for further review and analysis.  The operational review work program is the plan of action for conducting the operational review.</p>
<hr id="bk8094036"/>
<h1>Workpapers</h1>
