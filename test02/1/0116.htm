<h2>Examination of Past Review and Audit Reports</h2>
<p>Past review and audit reports (internal and external) may be a valuable source of information in determining direction of effort. There should be an examination not only of reports prepared by the internal or external review or audit groups, but also of those of other internal review organizations, as well as supervisory groups, where applicable, such as bank examiners. The reviewer should determine whether management agrees with specific review or audit findings, particularly if mentioned by more than one review or audit group, and whether any action has been taken to correct the situation.</p>
<h2>Physical Inspection of the Activities</h2>
<p>A physical inspection of activities requires alertness for signs of ineffectiveness or inefficiency, such as bottlenecks, excess accumulations of equipment or material, and idleness of personnel. Such inspections may disclose serious weaknesses warranting inquiry, or they may depict a pattern prevalent throughout the organization.</p>
<h2>Discussions With Responsible Personnel</h2>
<p>Finally, discussions with responsible officials and personnel directly concerned with the activity may assist in the identification of critical areas. Sometimes, valuable leads can be obtained through discussions with responsible officials and others directly concerned with the activities performed. These individuals can often identify troublesome areas or request that the reviewer look into specific matters that they are concerned about, but for which they lack information regarding the actual conditions.</p>
