<h2>Areas Not Selected for Review</h2>
<p>The other operational areas for which it is determined that additional operational review work will not be performed at this time are not to be merely put aside. They should all be mentioned to organizational and departmental management in an oral and/or <a title="Glossary Term:Written report" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk8094037.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">written report</a>, recommending further action, such as the following:</p>
<h3>1. Immediate Action</h3>
<p>For example, facility changes to be made so that buyers have privacy when talking with vendors and a set schedule established for vendor appointments</p>
<h3>2. Further Analysis and Review by Organizational and Departmental Management</h3>
<p>For example, management might consider changing the purchasing department reporting to the Vice President of Operations, as well as other conflicting units such as inspections, inventory control, and warehouse</p>
<h3>3. Future Operational Review by Operational Review Team or Internal Departmental Personnel</h3>
<p>For example, the review of special approval procedures, such as capital expenditures, over budget limitations, and special projects</p>
