<p><b>(A). Search for Insight</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Answers to these questions should provide insight into the organization's objectives, activities, work performance, systems and procedures, limits of authority, and so on. The reviewer uses the questionnaire as a guideline and does not rely solely on yes-or-no responses. This is a quick review tool to help identify critical areas for further review where it is not feasible to implement the more desirable but time-consuming, full-planning phase. A survey of this kind should not be used in lieu of the planning phase, as it is still the reviewer's responsibility to substantiate, with adequate evidence, the identification of critical operational areas to be reviewed.</p>
<p><b>(B). Example of Survey</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Exhibit 1.3 is a sample operational review initial survey form. The purpose of the initial survey is to identify areas of major importance in the total organization or specific operations to be reviewed. Improper identification results in spending unnecessary effort on less significant activities and insufficient effort in more important areas. The survey should provide for more detailed answers, rather than simple yes-or-no responses. The same questions are reviewed with various personnel; such as departmental management, functional supervision, and operations and support personnel. The reviewer thus isolates patterns of agreement and disagreement, as well as various interpretations and perceptions that lead to the correct conclusions. Where necessary, each question is supported by available documentation. This form could also be used as part of the more formal planning phase, but should be more specific to a departmental or functional area.</p>
