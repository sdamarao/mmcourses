<h2>Review of Organizational Planning and Budget Systems</h2>
<p>A good starting point for the reviewer in the planning phase is to understand the organization, why it is in existence, and what it is trying to accomplish (i.e., its goals and objectives). To accomplish this, the reviewer needs to understand the organization's long-term and short-term planning methods and related budgeting and control processes. The reviewer should focus on the organization's approach to planning and its integration with the budgeting process. The organization's planning and budgeting techniques should be a means of achieving improved organizational effectiveness. The reviewer should also be aware of the elements of an effective planning/budgeting system to compare to the practices of the organization under review.</p>
<h2>Strategic Planning</h2>
<p>There should be interaction and interdependence of the strategic (long-term) planning, short-term planning, detail planning, budgeting and monitoring processes. The planning process should be an essential first step in the preparation of an effective budget for the organization. By learning effective planning and budgeting procedures, the reviewer will be able to more effectively review and analyze such procedures as part of her/his organization-wide, departmental, or specific function operational review.</p>
