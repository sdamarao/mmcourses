<h3>1. Overall Organizational Operation</h3>
<p>One way to decide which functions to review is to determine how critical each function is to the overall organizational operation. For instance, for a manufacturing business, the most critical area might be the inventory or production control functions. For a service-oriented concern where personnel cost approximate 70 percent of total expenditures, the personnel function would be more critical. Normally, reviewers work with a limited budget in terms of hours allocated to the operational review, so they are greatly concerned with spending these hours on functional areas that offer the greatest potential for operational improvements in return for their effort. Criteria for determining a company's critical areas include the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas with large numbers in relationship to other functions; e.g., such as revenues, costs, percentage of total assets, number of sales, units of production, and personnel</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where controls are weak; e.g., a lack of an effective manufacturing control system, management reporting system, or organizational planning and control system</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas subject to abuse or laxity; e.g., there may be inventory and production controls that allow transactions to go unreported and undetected, uncontrollable time and cost reporting, and ineffective personnel evaluation procedures</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas that are difficult to control; e.g., there may be ineffective storeroom, shipping, or time recording procedures</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where functions are not performed efficiently or economically; e.g., there may be ineffective procedures, duplication of efforts, unnecessary work steps, inefficient use of resources, such as data processing equipment, overstaffing, and excess purchases</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(F)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas indicated by ratio, change or trend analysis; such as characterized by wide up or down when compared over a number of periods. Examples include sales changes by product line, costs by major category, number of personnel, inventory levels, and so forth.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(G)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where management has identified specific weaknesses or needs for such as personnel functions, manufacturing procedures, data processing operations, and management reporting</p>
</td>
