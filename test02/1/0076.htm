<h2>Missed Considerations</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Joe's projections proved inadequate. He had not taken into consideration three significant factors:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Investment of over $2 million dollars in plant and equipment to gain all of his projected manufacturing efficiencies. Remember the previous owners operated on a shared plant basis and Joe had to start from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Increase in sales to achieve his sales target from present customers and adding new customers would require increased sales efforts, possible lowering of prices, a more favorable credit terms. The previous owner did not actively look to increase this part of their business, as they saw it as a specialty service to their present customers.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>It would take time (probably at least 3 years) to achieve the projected sales volume of over $500,000 monthly sales to attain the $6,300,000 annual target.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>ACE Electronics Position</h2>
<p>ACE Electronics had enjoyed a unique position in their specialty circuit board division as demand for its products by existing customers exceeded its ability to supply the products. The division was able to sell all of its monthly allocated production quota of about $300,000 on a continuing basis with no real effort. Due to the nature of the specialty of the product to its customers, ACE could require in most cases cash payment at the time of delivery. ACE was also able to dictate delivery schedules that allowed them to intersperse their specialty board manufacturing into idle production slots of the main division. This was basically the concept and philosophy of the specialty board division&#8212;that is to fill in production gaps and assume some of the overhead of the main division.</p>
