<h2>Business Operations</h2>
<p>He and Flo initially set up the in-house production flow on large second hand wooden tables. When they needed to meet customer delivery commitments, they would have the vendors deliver the boards and at the same time contract with just the number of individuals (i.e., contract employees) to customize the product. Flo would train the production staff; supervise production, packing, and shipping; and bill the customers. Joe was responsible for engineering, purchasing, and vendor relations, and sales and marketing&#8212;working mainly out of his house and car. As Joe and Flo said in those days &#8220;they were one big happy family.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Business Cycle</h2>
<p>As Joe was able to get more business, the business cycle would continue. The first year Joe worked to build the business, and sticking with specialty and custom circuit boards only, had over $3,000,000 in sales with a reported net profit after Joe and Flo's salaries of about $440,000 (a net profit margin of over 13 percent&#8212;not bad for the first year of any business). He and Flo, of course, were working more than they had in their previous jobs. However, they now had one additional ingredient, ownership, and they were building appreciation in their own business.</p>
