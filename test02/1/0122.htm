<h3>5. Percentage Change</h3>
<p>Looking at changes in percentage between years also assists in providing proper perspective as to changes. For example, a different conclusion is reached when sales increase by $2 million over a previous year's sales of $4 million (a significant increase of 50 percent), than when the previous year's sales were $100 million (an increase of only 2 percent).</p>
<h3>6. Balance Sheet and Income Statement Review</h3>
<p>In the Example Company's Comparative Balance Sheets, there are other examples where the combination of dollar and percentage changes provide a more complete analysis and help to determine a future trouble spot. For instance, an accounts receivable increase from $1,600 in XXX8 to $1,900 in XXX9 does not appear too critical; however, expressed as an 18-percent increase (and as 7 percent of sales of $12,500), it takes on greater significance. As seen in the Example Company's Comparative Income Statements, sales increased by $500,000 from XXX7 to XXX8; however, cost of goods sold also increased by $500,000 exactly offsetting the change in sales and adding nothing to profitability.</p>
