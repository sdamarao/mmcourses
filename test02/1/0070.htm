<h3>2. Client's Personnel</h3>
<p>Another aspect to consider is that if the operational review is performed properly with the help of departmental personnel, the department retains the residual ability to perform operational review procedures in other areas. As the operational review team cannot normally cover every operational area that could be improved within the scope of the original operational review, the team should identify those additional areas for further review and, possibly, for review by the department. Management then decides whether to pursue these areas on their own or with the operational reviewer's help.</p>
<h3>3. Effectiveness of the Reviewer</h3>
<p>One of the goals in acquainting an organization with the operational review approach is to multiply the effectiveness of operational reviewers. In other words, while performing the operational review, reviewers are also training client personnel. In this way, operational review procedures and results are quickly multiplied throughout the organization, and the reviewers can then spend their time on the most significant areas and tasks.</p>
