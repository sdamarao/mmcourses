<h3>3. Economy and Efficiency</h3>
<p>Economy and efficiency are both relative terms, and it is not possible to determine whether the area under review has reached the maximum practicable level of either. The reviewer and operations personnel are continually looking for best practices in a program of continuous improvements. Economy and efficiency are continually being appraised and improved upon. They are not put in place based on the operational review and then ignored.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Economy and efficiency is concerned with achieving the optimum balance between costs and results. In performing this part of the review, the reviewer evaluates cost minimization, emphasizing reduction of costs, but not to the point where results are not accomplished. In addition, productivity maximization may be analyzed, but not to the point where the costs become excessive. In evaluating economy and efficiency, the reviewer analyzes the use of resources such as people, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money. For example, the reviewer might analyze the following:</p>

  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
