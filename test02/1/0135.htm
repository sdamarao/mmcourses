<h2>Review of the Office Functions</h2>
<p>When I went to find Joe, he was in the midst of his next crisis, so I wandered around the office area and talked with those personnel I was able to catch in their offices. The following is what I found out on my quick review tour of the office area:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The office and its 30 employees was divided into the following functions:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Sales: 12 employees; a sales manager for each product line&#8212;in effect Joe was in four businesses, with 8 salespeople assigned as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Specialty boards: 2 sales people</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(2)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Custom boards: 1 person</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(3)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Defense business: 2 sales people</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(4)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Basic boards: 3 sales people</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Engineering Department: 9 employees; 6 engineers (one head engineer) and 3 draftspeople; with Joe unofficially functioning as &#8220;Engineering Manager.&#8221;</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Accounting Department: 5 employees; a CFO/Controller, an employee each assigned to Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Payroll, and General Ledger.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Purchasing: 4 employees; a Purchasing Manager and 3 purchasing agents/buyers</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Every employee in the office had a computer networked into a central file server. Other than the above functions, I found three other PCs in the office area&#8212;two for word processing and one for a spreadsheet application.</p>
