<h2>Business Growth</h2>
<p>Fairly quickly the word spread that Joe was providing a proprietary quality product at reasonable cost. Joe was now able to bring in more business than his little &#8220;garage shop&#8221; and he and Flo could handle by themselves. With Joe's initial success, he now believed that he had the business acumen to run any business successfully. Nothing builds incompetence greater than success. The company started to grow and grow and grow. During this period, I would see him every so often and he would tell me how well he was doing&#8212;you know in terms of square feet of production and office space, total sales, amount of backlog, number of employees and total payroll, and so on. I cautioned him not to grow too fast and lose control and those elements that had made him successful initially, but he didn't hear. He was becoming just like his previous employer. I asked Joe what he saw as the problems with his company. He started off telling me how well he was doing, again by the numbers. I stopped him and asked him specifically what was the trouble. After hesitating, he finally admitted that he was so successful, it was driving him crazy&#8212;and Flo was in therapy. They had become one big unhappy dysfunctional family.</p>
