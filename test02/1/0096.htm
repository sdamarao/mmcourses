<h2>Management's Focus</h2>
<h3>1. Purpose</h3>
<p>The starting point for the operational review is management's decision as to which operational area or areas are to be reviewed, and whether the operational review is to be preliminary or in-depth. Based on management's decision, the operational reviewer then starts the planning phase of the operational review. The primary purposes of the planning phase are to do the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Gather information about the operational area</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Identify possible operational problem areas</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Start to develop the basis for the operational review work program</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>note</b></span></p>
<p>The major purpose of a preliminary survey is to identify significant areas for improvement.</p>
</div>
<h3>2. Working Information</h3>
<p>In the planning phase, general working information on all-important aspects of the organization's operations is obtained in a relatively short time. This is usually accomplished on site, at the company's facilities. If this is a first-time review of this company or a new area of review, the reviewer may need to do some additional on-site research and learning, such as reviewing the company's planning and budget systems and its organizational structure and management.</p>
