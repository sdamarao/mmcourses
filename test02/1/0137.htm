<h2>Review of Organization and Employees</h2>
<p>Instead of the 80 or so employees Joe had claimed, there were actually over 130 (not including Joe and Flo), with as many office personnel controlling and supporting production operations. It was apparent that Joe had created a corporate empire, almost rivaling his former employer. I compared the original organization for Joe's initial &#8220;garage shop&#8221; business to the one I prepared for the present organization. The differences were not only staggering, but also Joe and the company were out of control. Joe's organization chart now looked like a camel (that is, a horse created by a committee). The organization had grown based on immediate crisis rather than on proper organizational principles. Quick review and analysis of the current organization showed some possible inefficiencies and organizational roadblocks, such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Instead of Joe and Flo handling all of the major functions, they now had 135 employees.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Gross payroll was now over $3,010,000. Compared to the present level of $6,250,000 in gross sales, this represents over 48 percent of sales. Even at this relatively high level, the company was able to earn $830,000 or 13.3 percent of sales.</p>
