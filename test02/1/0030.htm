<h3>6. Intent of the Operational Review</h3>
<p>The intent of the operational review is not to be critical of present operations but to review operations and develop a program of best practices and continuous positive operational improvements by working with management and staff personnel. This can be accomplished most effectively by working with operations personnel in areas where they recognize deficiencies and are willing to cooperate. The concept of operational reviews should be sold as an internal program of review directed toward improved economies and efficiencies that will produce increased operational results.</p>
<h3>7. Quality of Operations</h3>
<p>Operational reviewing got its start when management stopped being concerned solely with reviewing reported information, and started wondering why a transaction was made in the first place and if there was a better way to do it. Operational review is the process whereby the reviewer determines whether management is using the resources entrusted to them in the most economical and efficient manner, to achieve the most effective results of operations. The focus and scope of operations have changed in recent years. Management has increased demands for more relevant information regarding the conduct of its operations and related results than can be found in strictly financial data. Management seeks information with which to judge the quality of operations and make operational improvements. That is why operational review techniques are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.</p>
