<h3>2. An Operational View</h3>
<p>A typical financial audit step could be to determine whether vendor purchase requisitions and invoices have been properly approved; however, when looking at the operational aspects of vendor purchases, the reviewer might ask:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Were materials really needed? Were materials mistakenly ordered that could not be used owing to changes in production specifications, because the product specifications unit failed to communicate with the purchasing department?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Were quantities used or purchased reasonable? Assuming the materials were usable, were goods bought for inventory above calculated safety stock levels because of the fear of incurring a stock-out?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Was there avoidable waste and exposure to damage or loss? Were steel components and parts that were susceptible to rust bought and stored in an outside yard, owing to an overcrowded inside storeroom?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Did the requisitioner exercise undue influence by stating specific sources or brands? Did the requisitioner specify an IBM&#174; micro-computer or a Xerox&#174; copier when a less expensive brand would do just as well?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
