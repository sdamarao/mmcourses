<h2>Operating and Management Reports</h2>
<p>Further sources of information are operations and management reports, submitted either internally or externally, prior and related review and audit reports and <a title="Glossary Term:Workpapers" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk8094036.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">workpapers</a>, and, if available, internal audit and review reports. The reviewer would also determine whether management has responded to any findings identified in these reports and whether any action has been taken.</p>
<h2>Physical Inspection</h2>
<p>Finally, the reviewer makes a physical inspection of the operation, including a tour of all pertinent operational areas and the observation of significant activities being performed. A physical review of the operations area, whenever appropriate, is made relative to the nature of the activities to be examined. The purpose of this physical review is to improve understanding of the activity in physical terms, and to provide support for information about the activity obtained during interviews.</p>
