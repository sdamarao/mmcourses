<h2>Business Background</h2>
<p>While he still wanted the big corporation comforts, he now was not willing to spend his money; for he realized that an unnecessary dollar spent in the business was a dollar out of his pocket. As part of the preliminary survey I talked to Joe to acquire a background of his business and his present position. Joe told me that he initially started his business, after acquiring it from ACE Electronics, in a large garage (that used to be a bicycle repair shop) with low rent. At that time, he and his wife Flo were the only employees. Joe started with three small contracts for specialized printed circuit boards that Joe had developed while previously employed at ACE. He established relationships with four circuit board vendors (after over a dozen turned him down) to provide him with the product as needed.</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>I took a quick look at what Joe was purchasing and realized rather quickly that he was ordering all customized boards. I suggested that Joe standardize his outside needs, and customize his product in-house, which would simplify his material purchasing for himself and his vendors as well as cut his material costs with no substantial increase in his manufacturing costs.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Joe readily accepted this suggestion with the comment &#8220;why didn't I ever think of that?&#8221; This is what is known as a &#8220;free bone,&#8221; that is providing something to the client either before you are engaged or in addition to contracted services. This approach also increases your professional credibility and enhances your image.</p>
