<h2>Operational Review Concepts</h2>
<h3>1. Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>Operational review can be defined as a process for analyzing internal operations and activities to identify areas for positive improvement in a program of continuous improvement. The process begins with an analysis of existing operations and activities, identifies areas for positive improvement, and then establishes a performance standard upon which the activity can be measured. The goal is to improve each identified activity so that it can be the best possible and stay that way. The best practice is not always measured in terms of least costs, but may be more what stakeholders&#39; value and expected levels of performance.</p>
<h3>2. The Customer</h3>
<p>Operational review processes are directed towards the continuous pursuit of positive improvements, excellence in all activities, and the effective use of best practices. The focal points in achieving these goals are the customers, both internal and external. They establish performance expectations and are the ultimate judges of quality. A company customer is defined as anyone who has a stake or interest in the ongoing operations of the organization, such as the following:</p>
