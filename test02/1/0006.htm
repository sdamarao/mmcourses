<h2>Why Businesses Are in Existence</h2>
<p>A starting point for establishing operational review measurement criteria is to decide which businesses the organization is really in so that operational efficiencies and effectiveness can be compared to such overall organizational criteria. Before one even thinks about performing an operational review of an organization, it is necessary to determine why the organization is in existence. When clients are asked this question, invariably the answer is to make money. Although this is partly true, there are really only two reasons for a business entity to exist.</p>
<h3>1. The Customer Service Business</h3>
<p>The first reason an organization exists is to provide goods and services to satisfy desired customers, so that they will continue to use the business's goods and services and refer it to others. An organizational philosophy that correlates with this goal that has been found to be successful is &#8220;to provide the highest quality products and service at the least possible cost.&#8221;</p>
<h3>2. The Cash Conversion Business</h3>
<p>Another reason an organization exists is to create desired goods and services so that the investment in the business is as quickly converted to cash as possible, with the resultant cash-in exceeding the cash-out (net profits or positive return on investment). The correlating philosophy to this goal can be stated as follows: &#8220;To achieve desired business results using the most efficient methods so that the organization can optimize the use of limited resources.&#8221;</p>
