<h3>4. The Budget</h3>
<p>In addressing the number of critical areas to be covered in the operational review, it is important to understand the relationship between budgeted review time and the scope of operational review work to be accomplished. In many situations, the budget hours are established first and then the scope of the operational review is made to fit within the budget. While this procedure may work from an internal standpoint in regard to budget and staffing, it does not fully take into account the aspect of such reviews that require flexibility and expandability of formulated operational review work programs. In addition, it is important for the reviewer and management to consider the cost against the expected benefits of the specific operational review. This is a significant concept in helping to determine how much time to allocate to the operational review. There are a number of factors to consider in establishing the operational review budget. They include the following:</p>
<p><b>(A). The Scope of the Operational Review</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Are all significant operational areas to be reviewed, or only the major ones identified?</p>
<p><b>(B). The Frequency of the Operational Review</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Is the operational review to be done on a one-time basis, which requires more up-front planning and research; or is it to be performed for an area that is reviewed on a regular basis and requires minimal up-front efforts?</p>
<p><b>(C). The Nature of the Business Operations</b> &#160;</p>
<p>For example, a service business dealing primarily with selling staff time, such as a medical, legal, or a CPA practice, would normally require less time for an operational review than a manufacturing business that produces, ships, sells, and services a fairly wide product line.</p>
<p><b>(D). The Degree of Management Effectiveness</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Functional areas that are ineffectively managed will normally require more operational review time than those that are more effectively managed.</p>
<p><b>(E). The Expectation of Benefits</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Those areas that afford the greatest expected benefits, in terms of the number of potential recommendations or savings, should be the areas reviewed first; however, these areas will take more time to review than those with lesser expectations.</p>
