<h3>1. Benchmarking</h3>
<p>Comparison within the same organization is also known as internal <a title="Glossary Term:Benchmarking" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk809403.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">benchmarking</a>, which looks for best results and related best practices. Comparison outside of an organization (competitors, industry, and best in class) is also known as external benchmarking, which looks for best practices that can be incorporated into operations in a program of continuous improvement.</p>
<h3>2. Consistency</h3>
<p>In making comparisons, it is important to be reasonably sure that the data are comparable; that is, that they are calculated on a consistent basis between or among years, companies, and so on. If not, incorrect or misleading conclusions may be drawn, resulting in the expenditure of a substantial amount of operational review time on the wrong functional area.</p>
<h3>3. Formatting</h3>
<p>An initial analytical procedure in financial statement analysis is to format the company's statements comparatively. This may entail comparing this year with last year or comparing a number of years&#39; data, arriving at numerical and/or percentage differences. Preparing statements in such comparative form can disclose valuable information as to present conditions and what to expect about future financial and operating performance.</p>
<h3>4. Horizontal Analysis</h3>
<p>Comparison of two or more years&#39; data is known as <a title="Glossary Term:Horizontal analysis" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk8094016.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">horizontal analysis</a>, which identifies changes over time by displaying data changes from year to year in both dollars and percentages. Dollar changes help to identify key factors having an impact on future operations, financial position, or profitability. The Example Company's comparative financial statements for the last three years are shown in Exhibit 2.4. These statements should be reviewed and then the possible critical areas of the Example Company's operations to be considered for operational review should be listed.</p>
