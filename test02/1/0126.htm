<h3>4. Financial Ratios</h3>
<table>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Proper financial analysis of an organization's results provides for the measurement and evaluation of its progress toward accomplishment of financial goals and objectives (e.g., earning an adequate return on investment or maintenance of a satisfactory financial position). The organization's financial position usually involves two fundamental considerations:</p>

  <tr>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Potential for Survival: measured by short-term liquidity (ability to meet short-term financial obligations) and long-term solvency (ability to meet long-term financial obligations)</p>

    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Financial ratios, which represent a mathematical relationship between two quantitative conditions, are the primary method used for such financial analysis. Measured over a period of time, these ratios can be used to identify changes or trends in operations. They can also be used to provide information for identifying operational trouble spots. By analyzing changes, inconsistencies, and trends using ratios, and comparisons between time periods of various accounts (such as inventory, sales, expenses, etc.), they can also provide advice and insight into the client's operations as well as indicate where the most critical problems might lie. These ratios should be analyzed in combination as well as related to specific operations.</p>

<h2>Identifying Critical Areas</h2>
<p>As a result of the initial survey and analysis of financial statement data of the Example Company, the operational reviewer is able to help management identify its critical operational areas where operational review procedures would provide the most benefits. This step is not always required, as quite often management has already decided which areas would provide the biggest payout by an operational review.</p>
