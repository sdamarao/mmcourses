<p class="subhead">Introduction</p>
<p>We designed this MicroMash course to help you master the subject matter in an easy, efficient manner.</p>
<p>As you work your way through each lesson, you will encounter study questions that check your comprehension of the preceding material. At the end of each lesson you will be given a short test, with five questions. You may quit the course at any time. The program will remember your place in the course.</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpChecks.gif" style="float:right;">Your progress through the course will be indicated by check marks next to lesson numbers in the Table of Contents on the right of the screen. While we recommend that you work your way through the lessons in the order they appear, you may choose to go to any lesson at any time by opening the Table of Contents and selecting the desired lesson.</p>
<p>Note: Since new accounting and auditing standards, tax laws, and regulations may have a substantial impact upon the content of this course, you are allowed one year from the date of purchase to complete the course and its exam.</p>
</div>
<div id="NAVIGATION">
<p><a name="NAVIGATION"></a></p>

<p class="subhead">Course Navigation</p>
<p>The title of the course and the title of the current section appear just below the menu at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpBubble.gif" style="float:right;">The bubble in the upper right corner of the screen displays the current lesson and page (screen).</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpNextPrev.gif" style="float:right;">When you have finished reading a page and wish to see the next one, Select the Next button (&quot;&gt;&quot;) in the lower right corner of the screen. To return to the previous page, Select the Previous button (&quot;&lt;&quot;), also in the lower right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpOutline.gif" style="float:right;">To go to any section in the course, use the Table of Contents on the right of the screen. This is normally closed, showing only the lesson numbers, checked off as you complete them. Select the left-facing arrow above the lesson numbers or select the bubble in the upper right corner of the screen, and the box will slide open to display the lesson titles. Select the triangular arrowhead next to a lesson title and that title will expand downward, listing the sections. Select any lesson or section title and the program will take you to the first page of that lesson or section.</p>
</div>
<div id="STUDY QUESTIONS">
<p><a name="STUDY QUESTIONS"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Study Questions</p>
<p>The study questions in each lesson will help you review and master the material and will prepare you for the lesson test. Read the study question, select or enter your answer choice(s), then select the Grade My Answer button below the answer choices to receive feedback. If your answer was incorrect, you may try again or select the Show Correct Answer button below the answer choices. When you are ready to move on, select the Next button (&quot;&gt;&quot;) in the lower right corner of the screen.</p>
</div>
</div id="QTYPES">
<a name="QTYPES"></a><p>There are several types of study questions.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="MC"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Multiple Choice</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpOneAnswer.gif" style="float:right; ">Select one answer from a set of answer choices, usually labeled A, B, C, and D, by clicking on the circle next to the letter of your choice. (Circles indicate there is <i>only one</i> correct answer choice.)</p>
<p><a name="TF"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">True/False</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpTF.gif" style="float:left;margin-right:8;">Read all True/False questions carefully. They are sometimes phrased so that a quick reading might lead to an incorrect response. Select your answer by clicking on the appropriate circle.</p>
<p><a name="PAT"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Pick-All-That-Are-True</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpManyAnswers.gif" style="float:right; ">This type of question offers a set of answer choices of which at least two are correct. Select all the choices you know to be correct by clicking on their boxes, and check marks will appear in the boxes. (Boxes indicate there is <i>more than one</i> correct answer choice.) Click again on a box if you wish to uncheck and withdraw that answer choice.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="TEST">
<p><a name="TEST"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Test</p>
<p>A short test consisting of five questions concludes every lesson. Test questions are mostly multiple choice or pick-all-that-are-true (see above). Remember that <i>boxes</i> mean the correct answer requires you to select <i>two or more</i> answer choices (pick-all-that-are-true questions); <i>circles</i> indicate that only one choice is correct (multiple-choice questions).</p>
<p>You may not submit your answers for grading until you have answered all five questions.</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpTestButtons.gif" style="float:right;">You may move among the questions by clicking on the numbered buttons to the left of the test questions. Once you have answered a question, its corresponding button will turn gray to indicate this, but you may still return to any question later to change or modify your answer. You may also move among the questions by using the Next and Previous buttons in the lower right corner.</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpGradeTest.gif" style="float:left;margin-right:8;">Once you have answered all five questions, the Grade Test button will become active. It is located in the lower right corner of the screen, above the Next and Previous buttons. Select the Grade Test button to have your answers graded.</p>
<p>In order to pass a lesson test and, where appropriate, receive CPE credit, you must earn a score of 80% or higher (4 out of 5 test questions). To move on to the next lesson (if applicable), press the Next button in the lower right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>If you do not pass, you will be given an opportunity to review material concerning those questions you missed. Use the Next button in the lower right corner to see these review screens. You may then take the lesson test again (though some or all of the questions will be different).</p>
<p>The course will not inform you which questions you missed.  This is a requirement of NASBA certification.</p>
<p>You may take a lesson test at any time by selecting it in the Table of Contents on the right side of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div id="SEARCH">
<p><a name="SEARCH"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Search</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpSearch.gif" style="float:left;margin-right:8;">Your MicroMash course has a search function. You may look for occurrences of any word or phrase anywhere in the course including glossary terms but excluding test questions and supplemental materials in PDF, HTML, or Excel format. Type the words (e.g., annuitant accrual beneficiary) or quoted phrases (e.g., "capital stock" "attest engagement") into the Search text field in the menu at the top of the screen. Then select Search. You will be given a ranked list of course pages and glossary terms in which those words or phrases appear.</p>
</div>
<div id="TOOLKIT">
<p><a name="TOOLKIT"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Toolkit</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpToolkit.gif" style="float:left;">The menu at the top of the screen contains a Toolkit item (Toolkit). Clicking on Toolkit displays a list of additional materials. Many MicroMash courses include supplemental files in PDF, HTML, Word, or Excel format.  References throughout the course to supplemental materials are hyperlinked. PDF supplements are displayed using Adobe Acrobat Reader and may be printed using the print feature of the Reader.</p>
</div>
<div id="GLOSSARY">
<p><a name="GLOSSARY"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Glossary</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpGlossary.gif" style="float:right;">The menu at the top of the screen contains a glossary item (Glossary). Clicking on Glossary displays a list of technical terms.  References throughout the course to glossary terms are hyperlinked. Clicking on these underlined references or the terms in the glossary dropdown will bring up the appropriate glossary text in a new window.</p>
</div>
<div id="PRINTING">
<p><a name="PRINTING"></a></p>
<p class="subhead">Printing</p>
<p><img src="common/images/helpPrint.gif" style="float:left;margin-right:8;">The menu at the top of the screen contains a print item (Print). This feature enables you to print any lesson of the course and also allows you to print your certificate.</p>
<p>Clicking on Print displays a list of course lessons, including an entry for the certificate. Clicking on an entry in this list will bring up a separate browser window containing either the entire selected lesson or your certificate. Use your browser's File/Print menu option to print the lesson or your certificate.</p>
