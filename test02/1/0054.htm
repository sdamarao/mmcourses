<h2>Types of Review and Review Phases</h2>
<p>The operational reviewer may perform two types of review: preliminary and in-depth. The difference between the two is the degree of emphasis, the specific techniques chosen, and the objectives of a particular phase. In a preliminary review, fieldwork might consist of limited transaction testing and interviewing. The report may be a briefing to management. In an in-depth review, fieldwork might consist of detailed examination using techniques such as work measurement, workload analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and so on. The report may be formally written, with wider distribution. Each of the two types of reviews has five phases. The operational <a title="Glossary Term:Review phases" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk8094031.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">review phases</a> can be described as follows:</p>
<h3>1. Planning</h3>
<p>The reviewer obtains general information about the kinds of activities performed, the general nature of those activities and their relative importance, and other general information to help plan the early portions of the review.</p>
<h3>2. Work Programs</h3>
<p>The reviewer prepares the operational review work program for the preliminary review of those activities selected for review in the <a title="Glossary Term:Planning phase" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk8094027.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">planning phase</a>. Well-constructed work programs are essential for conducting operational reviews in an efficient and effective manner. Such programs must be individualized for each situation, and each work step must state clearly the work to be done and why.</p>
<h3>3. Fieldwork</h3>
<p>The reviewer analyzes operations to determine the effectiveness of management and related controls. Such functions and controls are tested in actual operation, with particular emphasis on areas difficult to control and having high potential for weakness. The purpose of this phase is to determine whether a situation needs improvement, whether it is significant, and what should be done about it.</p>
