<h2>Organizational Structure and Role of Management</h2>
<p>Theoretically, organizations are put together so that the entity can conduct its business more efficiently, and so that the owners and/or top management can multiply their effectiveness (i.e., maximize their desired results). Organizing is intended to be a helping process to enable us to conduct our business better. For many organizations it has become a costly getting-in-the-way process. As part of the planning phase, the <a title="Glossary Term:Operational reviewer" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk8094024.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">operational reviewer</a> must ascertain whether the organization is properly organized or whether improper organization is the cause of its problems.</p>
<h3>1. Organizational Controls</h3>
<p>Adequate organizational control requires that each employee know clearly what her/his role and function is in the organization, and exactly what authority and responsibility have been assigned. It also requires proper separation of duties so that the same individual is not charged with the responsibility for recording and reporting on how a particular task has been accomplished.</p>
