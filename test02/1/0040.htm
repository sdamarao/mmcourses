<h2>Why Perform an Operational Review</h2>
<p>What are some of the reasons an operational review should be performed? The focus and scope of many operations have changed in recent years. Management has increased demands for more relevant information on the conduct of their operations and the related results than can be found solely in financial data. Both business and government management seek more information with which to judge the quality of operations and make operational improvements. That is why we need operational review techniques to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.</p>
<h3>1. General Purpose</h3>
<p>An operational review involves a systematic review of an organization's activities in relation to specified objectives. The general purposes of the operational review could be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><b>(A). Assess Performance</b> &#160;</p>
<p>To assess performance is to compare the way an organization conducts its activities with: objectives established by management, such as organizational policies, standards, goals, objectives and detail plans; comparisons to other similar functions or individuals within the organization (internal benchmarking); and comparisons to other organizations (external benchmarking).</p>
<p><b>(B). Identify Opportunities for Improvement</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Increased economy, efficiency, or effectiveness is the broad categories under which most improvements are classified. The reviewer may identify specific opportunities for improvement (best practices) by analyzing interviews with individuals (within or outside of the organization), observing operations, reviewing past and current operational data, analyzing transactions, making internal and external comparisons, and exercising professional judgment based on experience with the organization or others.</p>
