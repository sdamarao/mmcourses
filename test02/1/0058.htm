<h3>2. Willingness</h3>
<p>Another factor to consider when choosing critical operational areas to review is the willingness of the personnel to cooperate in the performance of the review. First, those in operational management should want to have their operations reviewed and be willing to work with the reviewers in improving their operations. Without such top-management commitment, the operational review is not likely to succeed. Second, staff and operating personnel must be willing to work with the reviewers both in performing the operational review and in the subsequent implementation of operational improvements.</p>
<h3>3. Cooperation</h3>
<p>Cooperation at all levels of the organization is essential to a successful operational review. The reviewer must enlist the cooperation of all personnel; members of management to ensure top commitment to the review, and operations personnel to help in identifying areas to review and proposed improvements. Normally, in most operations, the staff or operating personnel know precisely what is going on day by day, and with firsthand knowledge of operations, can help you to identify the most critical areas to review.</p>
