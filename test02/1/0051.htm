<h3>11. Identifying Possible Trouble Spots in Future Operations</h3>
<p>Many times the reviewer senses a future problem based on troubles in the past. For instance, problems with past computer conversions may indicate future troubles with an extensive computer processing upgrade.</p>
<h3>12. Providing an Additional Channel of Communication Between Operating Levels and Top Management</h3>
<p>In many organizations, there is a clear (or unclear) separation between management and operations; that is, management makes the decisions and operations personnel carry them out. One of the most important benefits of the operational review is the reviewer's ability to convey operational concerns to management in those instances where such concerns are not being communicated on an ongoing basis.</p>
<h3>13. Providing an Independent, Objective Evaluation of Operations</h3>
<p>Both management and operations personnel are often too close to what is going on within their own operations to effectively evaluate their results. The independent operational reviewer can do this objectively, pointing out those areas in need of improvement as well as those that are being performed well.</p>
