<h2>Analysis of Initial Survey Form</h2>
<p>One of the first steps in the planning phase is to analyze the organization's responses to an initial survey form, such as the one shown in Exhibit 2.5.</p>
<p>Exhibit 2.5 Operational Review Initial Survey Form is available as a pdf supplement through this link and Tools.</p>
<h3>1. Planning and Budgeting</h3>
<p>There are no real planning systems in place. The only defined goal is to be the biggest possible in terms of sales and income, which may create a conflict. In the absence of effective planning systems, the budget system does not integrate with the company's plans, but is merely a broad projection for the next year (based on Joe's wishes rather than any reality) compared on a monthly basis by the controller.</p>
<h3>2. Personnel and Staffing</h3>
<p>The organization is growing out of control. It appears that there are too many employees in almost every function, with a good possibility that instead of providing increased efficiency, they often get in everyone else's way. Many employees do not seem to know exactly what they should be doing; there is possibly more filling of time than achievement of desired results. Personnel hiring, orientation, training, supervision, evaluation, promotion, and firing practices have to be reviewed and greatly improved; there is too much control by Joe and the department managers.</p>
