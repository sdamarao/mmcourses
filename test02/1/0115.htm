<h2>Identification of Key Activities</h2>
<p>The information obtained may disclose key activities or aspects of an activity that appear to be difficult to control or susceptible to abuse or laxity. For instance, in a purchasing operation, the key critical areas might well be the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Determinations of quantities and qualities to be purchased</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Methods used in obtaining the most advantageous price</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Methods of determining whether the correct quantities and qualities are actually received</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Use of Management Reports</h2>
<p>Examining the reports management uses to assure itself that work is progressing within established time and cost goals should provide valuable information in selecting areas of inquiry. Examples of such reporting is operational exception reporting and actual versus plan reporting, which would compare actual results with goals and objectives. The reviewer should look closely at those items management has selected as critical for exception reporting, such as inventory levels, productivity measures, sales analysis, and so on. Indications of critical area to look at will surface if major deviancies are found between the plan and actual results. Keep in mind that the plan could be all right and the operational results critical, or vice versa.</p>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>note</b></span></p>
<p>Where such reports are not being used effectively, the reviewer should inquire as to the methods by which control is exercised. This inquiry may point to a lack of effective control with related administrative weakness. It may disclose other less formal control procedures, which may, in turn, disclose operational weaknesses. Similar considerations would apply if proper performance yardsticks have not been established.</p>
