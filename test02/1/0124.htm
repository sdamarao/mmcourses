<h3>2. Trend Percentages</h3>
<p>Financial statement analysis can also be accomplished through the use of trend percentages, which are used to state a number of years&#39; financial data in terms of a base year. The rule in using trend percentages is that at least three data points need to be examined before a trend can be identified.</p>
<p><b>Example 2.1&#8212;Trend Percentages</b> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Consider the Example Company:</i> &#160;</p>

</center><p><i>Analyzing the dollar data alone, it could be concluded that both sales and net income have increased over the three-year period. However, it cannot readily be concluded how fast sales have increased and whether the increases in net income have kept pace with sales increases. Using dollar data alone may make it difficult to conclude adequately. Now, assume that the base year XXX7 is equal to 100 percent; the other years can be stated as a percentage of the base year:</i> &#160;</p>

</center><p><i>By using these trend percentages as well as the differences in real dollars (or numbers), the increase in sales and net income can be put into proper perspective. It can now be clearly seen that the relative growth in sales has been surpassed by the growth in net income; sales in XXX9 are 19 percent greater than the base year, but net income is 33 percent greater. Note also that sales growth was better than net income growth in XXX8, and that the growth in sales in XXX9 over XXX8 was considerably below the growth in net income for the same year. Such an analysis could indicate major operational areas for review, such as sales analysis, cost of goods sold analysis, selling price procedures, and cost analysis.</i> &#160;</p>
