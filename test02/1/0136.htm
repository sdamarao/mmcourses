<h2>Other Functions Using Office Space</h2>
<p>In addition I found the following functions, not included as production or office, but occupying office space:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Quality Control (really a production function, but housed in the office area): 7 employees; a QC Manager and 6 QC inspectors&#8212;one assigned to each production team (whether they needed it or not).</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Customer Service: 3 employees; a manager and two others; who spent their day dealing with customer calls and complaints&#8212;mainly late deliveries and after sale issues.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Personnel: 2 employees: a Personnel Manager and one assistant.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Joe's Office: which included himself as President/CFO and 3 Assistants to the President (who turned out to be troubleshooters for the crises that Joe could not handle).</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Vice-President's Office: for Flo (who rarely appeared) and two assistants. Formal title: Vice President of Operations.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Clerical Staff: 24 employees; 4 each for sales and accounting, 3 each for engineering and purchasing, 2 each for customer service, personnel, and quality control, 1 each for Joe and Flo, plus 2 receptionists.</p>
</li>
