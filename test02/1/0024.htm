<h3>3. Operational Review Skills and Abilities</h3>
<p>The attributes of an effective operational reviewer would be helpful to any manager. While managers should have analytical ability, they may use it primarily to perform repetitive tasks. Operational reviewers, on the other hand, use these skills and abilities to assess a user's situations and recommend positive operational improvements.</p>
<p><b>(A). Balance</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The difference between required attributes for operational personnel and operational reviewers is similar to the difference between the left brain and the right brain. The left brain, which controls thinking and calculation processes, is more important to operations personnel performing repetitive tasks; whereas the right brain, which controls creativity and perceptual skills, is more critical to the operational reviewer. Basically, the operational reviewer needs a good balance of both, yet with a greater emphasis on the creative and perceptual side. This is why the best manager or operating personnel does not always make the best operational reviewer and why things tend to stay the same.</p>
<p><b>(B). Analytical Techniques</b> &#160;</p>
<p>To render effective services, the operational reviewer must have substantial knowledge of the total environment of the organization being examined and a high degree of skill and experience with the analytical techniques and tools needed to solve problems. The operational reviewer should also have sensitivity to, and understanding of, the values and goals of all the various people that make up a going concern.</p>
<p><b>(C). Problem Identification and Analytical Skills</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Someone trained in operating systems and procedures need not spend many years learning new methods before engaging in operational reviews, as the basic techniques are the same. They mainly need to sharpen the problem identification and analytical skills they already possess. Operational reviews can be viewed as 80 percent practical analysis and common sense and 20 percent technical know-how.</p>
