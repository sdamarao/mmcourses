<h2>Leasing Insurance Costs</h2>
<p>During the course of your operational review procedures, you found that the company was paying for liability and property damage insurance as part of their lease agreement on 14 tractors and 19 trailers. The cost of the insurance was hidden in the fixed weekly/mileage rates billed by the lessor. The company's policy is to self-insure or assume certain risks (such as auto collision and certain other property losses, and the front end of unknown claims such as liability claims) and to purchase protection for any other risks under a blanket policy.</p>
<h2>Question and Solutions for Consideration</h2>
<h3>1. What Steps Would You Take to Follow Through on This Operational Practice?</h3>
