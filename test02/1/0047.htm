<h2>Benefits of Operational Reviews</h2>
<p>Depending on its scope, an operational review can be of significant benefit to top management and staff, in some or all of the following ways:</p>
<h3>1. Identifying Problem Areas, Related Causes, and Alternatives for Improvement</h3>
<p>This is a major purpose of operational reviews. Although often aware of a problem, management cannot always define exactly its dimensions. The reviewer's third-party objective viewpoint helps to achieve the proper focus on operational problems. To define a problem in some instances, the reviewer need merely talk to operations personnel and then share her/his viewpoints with management. Keep in mind that people in operations are usually more aware of problems and their causes than management personnel. The reviewer's role is also to identify the actual causes (not the symptoms or believed causes) of problems, which may be the result of management policy or actions. Finally, the reviewer must formulate realistic, practical solutions to these problems. This is where the reviewer's experience in working with numerous other departments and/or organizations is valuable. Remember, organizations are always looking for best practices (internal or external) that can be practically implemented in a particular situation as part of a program of continuous improvement. A good rule for the reviewer to follow is not to recommend any course of corrective action that s/he could not assist in implementing.</p>
<h3>2. Locating Opportunities for Eliminating Waste and Inefficiency</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that each dollar of cost reduction (without sacrificing efficiency or effectiveness) contributes dollar-for-dollar to the bottom line. Cost reduction is a significant element in operational reviews. Be wary of short-term cost reductions causing long-term problems (e.g., downsizing of operations and/or personnel when business falls off). It is the role of the reviewer to assist the company to operate at the lowest possible cost in relationship to adequate plans. Costs should always be at the correct level, and when costs need to be cut, proper decisions are made so as not to adversely impact operations. This is in contrast to typical cost cutting across the board, which not only constricts all operations, but also fails to provide for the necessary resources for those operations that actually need increased funds.</p>
