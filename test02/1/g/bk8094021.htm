<h1>Operational review</h1>
<p>A widely used term encompassing many aspects and techniques; however, no uniform, commonly recognized definition has been unanimously accepted.  Combining definitions, it could be said that an operational review is a review of operations performed from a management viewpoint to evaluate the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of any and all operations, limited only by management's desires.  It is a process for analyzing internal operations and activities to identify areas for positive improvement in a program of continuous improvement.</p>
