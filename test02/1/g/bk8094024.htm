<h1>Operational reviewer</h1>
<p>Anyone with the appropriate skills that performs an operational review; however, internal and/or external consultants, because of their knowledge of the operations and their analytical skills, are typically requested to perform such services.  In some organizations, a separate operational review unit trained in operational review concepts is established.  Operational reviewers use their skills and abilities to assess a user's situations and recommend positive operational improvements.</p>
