<h1>Operational review</h1>
<p>A widely used term encompassing many aspects and techniques; however, no uniform, commonly recognized definition has been unanimously accepted.  Combining definitions, it could be said that an operational review is a review of operations performed from a management viewpoint to evaluate the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of any and all operations, limited only by management's desires.  It is a process for analyzing internal operations and activities to identify areas for positive improvement in a program of continuous improvement.</p>

<h1>Benchmarking</h1>
<p>Comparison of outputs or processes.  Comparison within the same organization is also known as internal benchmarking, which looks for best results and related best practices.  Comparison outside of an organization (competitors, industry, and best in class) is also known as external benchmarking, which looks for best practices that can be incorporated into operations in a program of continuous improvement.</p>

<h1>Cash Conversion Business</h1>
<p>Business that creates desired goods and services so that the investment in the business is as quickly converted to cash as possible, with the resultant cash-in exceeding the cash-out (net profits or positive return on investment).

<h1>Basic business principles</h1>

<hr id="bk8094024"/>
<h1>Operational reviewer</h1>
<p>Anyone with the appropriate skills that performs an operational review; however, internal and/or external consultants, because of their knowledge of the operations and their analytical skills, are typically requested to perform such services.  In some organizations, a separate operational review unit trained in operational review concepts is established.  Operational reviewers use their skills and abilities to assess a user's situations and recommend positive operational improvements.</p>

<hr id="bk8094018"/>
<h1>Interviewing</h1>
<p>Process generally limited to management, along with some interviewing of operations personnel, in the planning phase.  In the fieldwork phase, interviews are not limited to management, but primarily include those employees who actually do the work so as to determine what is going on and why.</p>
<hr id="bk8094023"/>
<h1>Operational review triangle</h1>
<p>The three Es of operational review: economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.</p>
<hr id="bk8094012"/>
<h1>Evidence</h1>
<p>Matter that should be considered in the operational review and includes the following types: physical observations, photos, slides, etc.; testimonial interviews, personal statements, etc.; documentary letters, contracts, grants, records, etc.; and analytical an analysis of information.</p>
<hr id="bk8094031"/>
<h1>Review phases</h1>
<p>Phases that consist of planning, work programs, fieldwork, development of findings and recommendations, and reporting.</p>
<hr id="bk8094027"/>
<h1>Planning phase</h1>
<p>Period in which the operational reviewer first learns about the organization's operations through various techniques, such as reviewing planning and budget systems, interviewing, reviewing organizational structure and management, gathering and analyzing information, analyzing financial data and statements, inspecting facilities and work procedures, and so forth.</p>
<hr id="bk8094013"/>
<h1>Fieldwork phase</h1>
<p>Period in which work steps are performed, as defined in the work program phase.  The purpose of the fieldwork phase is to determine whether all functions and activities included in the review are being performed economically, efficiently, and effectively.</p>
<hr id="bk8094028"/>
<h1>Ratio, change, and trend analysis</h1>
<p>Technique used in the fieldwork phase to strengthen and supplement other operational review tools and procedures.  Using this technique, the reviewer critically examines, interprets, and explains relationships between sets of operating and financial data at a given point in time by comparing them over a number of periods.  Ratios have no intrinsic significance; they are primarily useful in highlighting significant changes and relationships.</p>
<hr id="bk8094036"/>
<h1>Workpapers</h1>
<p>Documentation prepared by the reviewer to have a record of what was done and to accumulate the data.  These are the principal records of the work actually performed to substantiate the operational review report.  The review workpapers must be complete and self-explanatory.  They are the tangible means of measuring the operational review team's professional skill.</p>
<hr id="bk8094015"/>
<h1>Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</h1>
<p>Common set of accounting principles, authoritative standards, and procedures set by recognized policy boards that organizations use to compile their financial statements.</p>
<hr id="bk8094016"/>
<h1>Horizontal analysis</h1>
<p>A comparison of two or more years' data which identifies changes over time by displaying data changes from year to year in both dollars and percentages. Dollar changes help to identify key factors having an impact on future operations, financial position, or profitability. Looking at changes in percentage between years also assists in providing proper perspective as to changes.</p>
<hr id="bk8094037"/>
<h1>Written report</h1>
<p>Report issued to provide official recognition of completion of the review and highlights, in writing, the review results.  The more formal written report benefits operations personnel, as well as review team members.  For review team members, the written report serves as a source of information concerning the work done and as a resource for future reviews.</p>
<hr id="bk8094035"/>
<h1>Work program phase</h1>
<p>Period of review of selected activities as determined in the planning phase.  It becomes the bridge between the planning phase and the fieldwork phase.  It is in the work program phase that the operational reviewer focuses on the significant operational areas identified in the planning phase and develops specific work steps for further review and analysis.  The operational review work program is the plan of action for conducting the operational review.</p>
<hr id="bk809405"/>
<h1>Consistency</h1>
<p>In making comparisons, it is important to be reasonably sure that the data are comparable; that is, that they are calculated on a consistent basis between or among years, companies, and so on.  If not, incorrect or misleading conclusions may be drawn, resulting in the expenditure of a substantial amount of operational review time on the wrong functional area.</p>
