<h1>Consistency</h1>
<p>In making comparisons, it is important to be reasonably sure that the data are comparable; that is, that they are calculated on a consistent basis between or among years, companies, and so on.  If not, incorrect or misleading conclusions may be drawn, resulting in the expenditure of a substantial amount of operational review time on the wrong functional area.</p>
