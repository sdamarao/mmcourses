<h3>5. External consulting Firm</h3>
<p>An external consulting firm proposing to perform an operational review for a client may have to estimate time and costs before starting an engagement. To do this requires sufficient initial survey work and adequate prior experience on similar engagements to enable the reviewer to estimate accurately. While it is obviously advantageous to estimate the amount of fieldwork required after completion of the planning phase, the client normally wants to know these amounts upfront. The samples provided are for a relatively sizable operational review. In a situation where potential operational review engagements may be smaller in scope, the two phases may be combined and the numbers scaled down.</p>
<h3>6. Internal Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>Although it is usually an external consulting firm that submits a proposal letter to management, it is also good practice for an internal group to submit a similar proposal prior to the start of the operational review engagement. The major purpose of such an internal proposal letter is to ensure clear communication, as to the purpose and scope of the operational review, between the review group and management. In this context, the internal proposal becomes a letter of understanding between the internal review group and management. The contents of the internal proposal letter would differ somewhat from an external proposal, and would only include those areas necessary to the situation.</p>
<h3>7. Sample of Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>An example of an operational review proposal letter is shown in Exhibit 1.4, with an accompanying sample time and cost budget estimates for the conducting of the operational review in Exhibit 1.5. These cost estimates are for the reviewer's use in determining the cost of the engagement and are not given to operations management.</p>
