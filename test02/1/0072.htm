<h3>2. What Happened in Real Life?</h3>
<p>In a &#8220;real life&#8221; version of this particular situation, it was found that lessor insurance costs totaled $39,000 for the year, and that the costs under the company's self-insurance and blanket policy would have been $6,000. Accordingly, an annual savings of $33,000 was realized by reverting back to the self-insurance policy. This situation would be reviewed periodically in the future to ensure that conditions had not changed or that other best practices had come into existence.</p>
