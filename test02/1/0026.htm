<h3>4. Recommendations</h3>
<p>Success as an effective operational reviewer is based on what is accomplished; that is, recommendations made to management that are subsequently implemented. Operational reviews should be fascinating and rewarding to the reviewer as well as operations personnel. The individual's stature as an operational reviewer, credibility of the entire review staff, management and others&#39; positive regard of the review staff all will increase in proportion to the degree of success attained in the operational review.</p>
<h3>5. Functional Disciplines</h3>
<p>Because of the number of different types and complexities of operational reviews and the varying skills required, supporting functional disciplines are often necessary to supplement the regular review staff's skills and abilities. It is not always practical to maintain personnel with all of the required skills on the operational review staff. One should consider the skills that are necessary for the successful conduct of each operational review, and either make sure that such skills are available on staff or contract for needed outside expertise.</p>
