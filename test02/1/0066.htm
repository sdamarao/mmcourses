<h2>Engagement Development</h2>
<p>An operational review could be conducted by an external consulting firm, an internal review group, an independent in-house unit, departmental personnel, or a combination of staff from these entities. Whichever organization has primary responsibility for conducting the operational review, the major steps in its development and performance should be similar.</p>
<h3>1. Recognize and Define the Problem</h3>
<p>The first step is to recognize and define the problem. Normally, it is management's prerogative to identify the major problem area or areas to be addressed in an operational review. If requested by management, the reviewer can assist in such problem definition as described previously, or the reviewer may perform a preliminary survey to identify significant operational areas to be reviewed.</p>
<h3>2. Gather Appropriate Data</h3>
<p>The second step is to gather the appropriate supporting data, and is usually accomplished by the operational reviewer. The purpose of this data gathering is to provide background information relative to the problem areas defined, so as to substantiate the problem situation.</p>
<h3>3. Evaluate the Situation</h3>
<p>The next step is to evaluate the situation within the organization to determine such things as the organizational structure and resources available. These are the factors on which the reviewer bases the proposal to management for conducting the operational review.</p>
