    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Although it is management's continuing responsibility to assess the results of operations, its objectives and measurement criteria are not always clearly defined. Without such clarification, the reviewer cannot meaningfully evaluate the results of operations. If management has not done so prior to starting the operational review, the reviewer should work with management to state the objectives, establish measurement criteria, and establish methods for accumulating the data necessary to measure achievement of operational results. Effectiveness is concerned with results and accomplishments achieved and benefits provided. In evaluating the effectiveness of operations, the reviewer asks whether the activity is achieving its ultimate intended purpose. Analysis is qualitative rather than quantitative.</p>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The relationship of economy and efficiency and their impact on results can be seen as a seesaw; that is, there is an attempt to balance them to achieve just the right amount of each. In a perfectly balanced situation, the cost of operations would be maintained at the lowest possible level without sacrificing efficiency (or the methods of operations) and effectiveness (or the results of operations)&#8212;thus effecting economy. At the same time, the methods of operations would be performed at the least possible cost without sacrificing results&#8212;thus producing efficiency. Can you see, then, why economy and efficiency are normally reviewed together as part of the operational review procedure?</p>
