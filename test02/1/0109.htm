<h3>2. Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>Why do organizations in the private and public sectors place more emphasis on the organizational structure of their operations? The answer, in most cases, is because that is how it has always been. If some people were not reporting to other people, they would not know what to do. How could anybody trust them to do their jobs without someone else to watch them? It has become standard procedure to departmentalize people without maintaining individual accountability. When there is trouble within the organization, it is simple to get rid of the entire department or the departmental scapegoat or troublemaker (normally the one who asks the right questions when nobody has good answers), and avoid facing the real cause of the problem. Many times the real problem is ineffective top management. Rather than admit to that, lower-level employees are blamed and let go.</p>

<p>Operational reviews are not designed to eliminate specific employees.</p>

<h3>3. Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness</h3>
<p>The real answer why organizations should organize is so that they can accomplish their desired results (be most effective) in the most economical manner (optimum use of limited resources) using the best available methods of operations (be most efficient). This is, of course, the three E&#39;s of operational reviews: economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. If we were able to accomplish the goals of the three E&#39;s (economy, efficiency, and effectiveness) in the first place, and keep things that way, we would not need the quick fixes. Rather than admit our mistakes and make the necessary corrections (i.e., do the right thing), we blame others.</p>
