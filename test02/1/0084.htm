<h2>The Operational Review Agreement</h2>
<p>After talking with Joe, reviewing his operations, general analysis of the financial statements, review of internal reports and so on; it was agreed that we would review the following functions of the Joe Sorry Company:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Personnel: both manufacturing and general and administrative, as to number and types of personnel necessary.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Manufacturing operations: such as production and inventory control methods and procedures.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Product line analysis: looking at sales, cost, and pricing considerations of the various products.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Profit center concepts: looking at the various businesses such as specialty boards, custom boards, defense business, and basic boards.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Operational reporting considerations: such as key operating indicators (KOI&#39;s), type of reporting, and use of reporting.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Planning and budget systems: including strategic and long term, organization and departmental short-term planning, detail planning, and effective budget techniques.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Proposal or Confirming Letter</h2>
<p>Based on our agreement with Joe, we submitted a proposal or confirming-type letter (see Exhibit 1.4 and Exhibit 1.5 Proposal Letter Budget Estimate for an example) as Joe had already agreed to have us perform the operational review. Note that if you are an internal auditor, it is still suggested that you submit such a document as a letter of understanding to your internal client. Once agreed upon by the client, this becomes your contract.</p>
