<h2>The Operational Reviewer</h2>
<p>An operational review can be performed by anyone with the appropriate skills; however, internal and/or external consultants, because of their knowledge of the operations and their analytical skills, are typically requested to perform such services. In some organizations, a separate operational review unit trained in operational review concepts is established. The most effective way in which to implement such procedures is to assign overall responsibility for implementing organization-wide operational review procedures, which would include the performance of operational reviews as well as training operations personnel in implementing these techniques in their areas.</p>
