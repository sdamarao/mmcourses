<h3>2. Additional Attributes</h3>
<p>Beyond those previously listed, the successful operational reviewer should possess the following attributes:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The ability to spot the trouble areas&#8212;to look at a given situation and quickly determine what is getting in the way</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The ability to identify the critical problem areas, so as to avoid chasing mice when one should be chasing elephants</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>note</b></span></p>
<p>The application of the <a title="Glossary Term:80/20 rule" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk809401.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">80/20 rule</a> states that operational reviews require 80 percent common sense and 20 percent technical expertise; and that 80 percent of the trouble areas cause 20 percent of the problems, and that 20 percent causes 80 percent of the problems.</p>
</div>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The ability to place oneself in management's position, to analyze the problem and ask questions from management's perspective</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>note</b></span></p>
<p>This is sometimes difficult as many times the reviewer has never been in an operational related management position. Even when this is not true, the reviewer may have difficulty understanding the constraints under which the manager must work&#8212;in effect, what they can and cannot do.</p>
</div>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The skill to effectively communicate operational review results</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<div class="Q">
<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>note</b></span></p>
<p>The success of an operational review is measured by the degree with which recommendations are implemented, and implementation is a direct by-product of effective communication. A rule of thumb is that the review has been successful if management is convinced to adopt more than 50 percent of the recommendations.</p>
