<h3>3. Locating Opportunities to Increase Revenues</h3>
<p>Increasing revenues also has an effect on the bottom line, yet only to the extent of profit margins for this additional amount of revenue. Increasing revenues may, in fact, be detrimental in terms of profits and operating efficiencies (both short-term and long-term profits). Often revenues or sales are increased to present a more favorable sales picture in the short term or to fill plant or service capacity, rather than on the basis of sound planning. Please note that in most organizations a greater amount of resources and emphasis is devoted to revenue improvement than to cost economies, even though effective cost cutting offers greater rewards.</p>
<h3>4. Identifying Undefined Organizational Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Procedures</h3>
<p>It would be nice to think that all organizations are doing effective long-term and short-term planning. In reality, this is usually more the exception than the rule. This means that the reviewer will have to assist management in recognizing undefined goals, objectives, and detailed plans and to assist in developing such plans prior to starting the operational review. For without defined plans, there are no yardsticks or milestones against which to measure the organization's effectiveness.</p>
<h3>5. Identifying Criteria for Measuring the Achievement of Organizational Goals</h3>
<p>There is great likelihood that plans and related goals and objectives are not in existence. Even when they do exist, there may not be appropriate criteria for measuring their achievement. The reviewer may have to assist management in the development of such criteria.</p>
