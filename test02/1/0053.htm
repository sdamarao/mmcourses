<h2>Specific Purpose</h2>
<p>In conducting an operational review, one should be aware of the purpose for conducting the review. Prior to the start of the operational review, the reviewer should communicate clearly her/his understanding of the purpose(s) to appropriate management personnel. There should be a mutual agreement as to the purpose in the beginning. For example, the purpose could be one or more of the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>To review and evaluate the adequacy of the accounting system and related internal accounting controls (including both accounting and administrative controls)</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>To analyze systems and controls; as related to internal controls, functional operations, and legal compliance</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>To analyze the capability to accomplish agreed-upon stated goals, objectives, and results in management's approved plan</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>To compare actual accomplishments/results with the goals and objectives established in management's plan for the period; and to determine reasons that established goals and objectives were not met</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>To analyze and explain cost overruns or high unit costs for each function/activity for which such data can be quantified</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>To assess and evaluate compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations; ensuring at least minimal compliance</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>To identify and report deficiencies and areas for improvement and to provide technical assistance and follow-up where necessary</p>
</li>
