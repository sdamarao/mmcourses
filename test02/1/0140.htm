<h3>3. Management</h3>
<p>Top management is really Joe&#8212;not effectively delegating. Flo has almost disappeared from the operations of the company. The Production Manager, although given authority over production, is continually being overridden by Joe. Middle management appears to be operating under similar conditions&#8212;that is, controlled by Joe. An effective management and operating reporting system does not exist. There is a need for delegating down to the lowest possible levels and keeping Joe from interfering with everyone's operations.</p>
<h3>4. Policies and Procedures</h3>
<p>No formal policies or procedures exist. This is causing great confusion overall within the organization and within most of the departments. There is too much control by management, with capricious changes by management making it difficult for employees to sense any <a title="Glossary Term:Consistency" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk809405.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">consistency</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Computer Processing</h3>
<p>There are personal computers in every department, one in almost every employee's workstation. Many are not being used at all; some are used minimally, others are used for packaged software applications. This area needs to be reviewed and analyzed to determine how an effective management and operating reporting system can be implemented.</p>
<h3>6. Manufacturing Systems</h3>
<p>Although there is a computerized manufacturing system for production and inventory control, it appears that it is being used ineffectively, mainly for routing customer orders through production and reporting inventory reorders (based on reorder points and reorder quantities) and on-hand inventory balances. The software is used to support ineffective manufacturing processes.</p>
<h3>7. Responsibility and Authority</h3>
<p>Responsibilities have not been clearly defined, so most employees do not know what they should be doing and what is expected of them. Although authority has been somewhat delegated to middle managers, Joe through his continual interference has sabotaged it.</p>
