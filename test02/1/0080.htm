<h2>Preliminary Survey</h2>
<p>As part of the operational review process, it is good practice to meet with the client initially and perform a preliminary review of their operations&#8212;prior to submitting a proposal letter (or internal letter of understanding) as to the scope of the review and related fees. This preliminary review is normally performed at no cost to the client and takes from a half to a full day. It is your means to learn about the client and develop a proposal that incorporates the client's major critical operational areas into the operational review, so that you can provide the greatest benefit to their operations.</p>
<h2>Understanding Basic Business Principles</h2>
<p>I started with Joe by explaining what I considered some basic business principles. Joe generally agreed with these principles although he, like many new business owners, had visions of sugarplums in his head as to having enormous physical plant and employees under his control. He wanted to be automatically large just like his previous employer; making the assumption that more was better. Joe wanted immediate gratification for being the boss and felt he should have the same perquisites as he had before. When I explained to him that when he worked for the large corporation he was spending &#8220;other people's money&#8221; (OPM), and now he was spending his money (OCI or our children's inheritance), he seemed to understand.</p>
