<div id="A" class="TEST">
<p class="mtb">The purpose of an operational review is to ensure that the organization or function under review is operating in the most economical, efficient, and effective (the three E&#39;s of operational review) manner possible. While the reviewer may be asked to look at the management bonus system, it typically would be a top management issue and not included in an operational review; however, the criteria for granting such bonuses might be included in the review as to their relevance to the three E&#39;s.</p>
</div>
<div id="C" class="TEST">
<p class="mtb">Employee evaluation systems tend to be conducted in a subjective ineffective manner. Typically, the operational review would not delegate time to review this system; however, as part of the review, the reviewer may look at the impact such a system has on operating effectiveness and developing better practices to encourage employee performance and results. The budget system is looked at as the manifestation of the planning process by allocating scarce resources to the achievement of planning systems goals and objectives&#8212;encompassing the three E&#39;s.</p>
</div>
<div id="D" class="TEST">
<p class="mtb">An acceptable good concept in the performance of the operational review is that the reviewer does not identify specific employees for downsizing but to develop procedures whereby the function and activity can be accomplished more economically and efficiently resulting in maximizing results. Such procedures may result in the function being able to be performed with fewer personnel; however, it is not the reviewer's job to identify which individuals are to be replaced, this is management's job. An operational review rule is that if the individual is a good employee (rather than get rid of them) the company should use them elsewhere in the company. The budget system is looked at as the manifestation of the planning process by allocating scarce resources to the achievement of planning systems goals and objectives&#8212;encompassing the three E&#39;s.</p>

<p>The operational review process typically starts by analyzing the organizations planning systems&#8212;that is to determine the agreed upon reasons why the organization is in existence and the related goals and objectives established by management to move them effectively in those directions. The budget system is looked at as the manifestation of the planning process by allocating scarce resources to the achievement of planning systems goals and objectives&#8212;encompassing the three E&#39;s.</p>
