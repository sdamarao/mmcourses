<h2>Background of Situation</h2>
<p>If the basic purposes for being in business, that is customer service and cash conversion, are understood, how have so many businesses gone astray? To illustrate some of these principles and the application of operational review concepts, let me share the story of one of my consulting clients whom we will call Joe Sorry. Joe was a professional friend of mine working for a large national electronics organization, as a top middle manager, but who wanted to have his own business. He knew he could run a business better than his present employers. He decided he was ready and hired me to assist him in putting his business together.</p>
<p>Joe had been employed by ACE Electronics for nearly 20 years, serving in a number of Engineering and manufacturing positions at various locations. Presently, Joe was assigned as plant engineer to a small division manufacturing specialty printed circuit boards for a select number of customers. The company had always looked at this division as a sharer of overhead, not as a growth profit center. In fact, the division shared manufacturing space with a larger division and was considered a divisional &#8220;step child.&#8221; The company had recently been purchased in a leveraged buyout, and the new owners were going through a program of divestiture and selling off of various divisions and facilities; as well as a program of cost cutting and employee downsizing.</p>
