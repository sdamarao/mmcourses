<h2>Educating the Client</h2>
<p>The first thing Joe wanted explained to him was if he was making so much money, why did the business not have any cash? Obviously, Joe's cash deficit was not due to anything magical, but developed predictably from his normal business operations. I explained a number of things to Joe about accrual accounting versus operational data, mainly:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Sales are recorded when made (goods shipped to the customer); and set up as accounts receivable; with cash being received at the time of payment.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Expenses are made on a different timing schedule from cash receipts. For example, payroll is paid when due, although you may not receive payback via customer sales until sometime in the future (typically over 30 days hence). This is also true of manufacturing costs such as materials and supplies.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Profits shown on the income statement are based on accrual accounting&#8212;that is sales are recorded when made not when accounts receivable are collected, and expenses are recorded as incurred not when they are paid from accounts payable.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Some expenses are handled via accounting entries such as depreciation and amortization, while prepaid items are recorded currently but they represent prior cash disbursements.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Expenditures for fixed assets, inventory, and other &#8220;deferred&#8221; expenses are paid for currently but do not immediately appear on the income statement.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Financial statements do not provide all of the necessary data needed to manage and operate effectively. For instance, the costs and profits generated for each manufacturing order, the number of on-time deliveries, the amount of returned merchandise, the amount and cost of rework, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Based on the above, Joe's profit for the current month of $101,000 turned into a cash deficit of $85,344. This exemplifies the difference between profitability and liquidity, and accrual versus operational reporting. Had Joe understood these principles, he could have avoided such operational problems. We agreed that we would look at the major aspects of Joe's operations during the course of our operational review.</p>
