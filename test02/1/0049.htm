<h3>6. Recommending Improvements in Policies, Procedures, and Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>The reviewer may find instances in which the cause of the problem lies with existing policies or procedures. Policies should be set by senior management and relate to the rules by which the organization conducts its business (e.g., service to the customer). Many times, such policies get in the way of operations personnel performing their functions (e.g., excessive controls and paperwork to process a customer credit) or insufficient authority is delegated to allow them to be most effective (e.g., sending a service representative to the customer to investigate a complaint). In these instances, the policies may be wrong and in need of correction.</p>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Procedures are the ways in which functions are performed based on stated policies. As such procedures refer to operations, it might seem that operations personnel would be involved in establishing and implementing such procedures. In most instances, management sets procedures, causing operations personnel to resist them and work against their success.</p>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The organization's structure tends to evolve over a period of time, with minimal regard to economy, efficiency, or effectiveness. In most organizations, there are built-in incentives to increase organizational levels, such as budget systems that reward the growth of organizations and encourage politicking to build empires. It is the reviewer's role to identify such organizational inefficiencies and to recommend improvements. It is then management's responsibility to decide what to do with extraneous personnel, possibly effecting departmental transfers, retraining, lateral moves, and so on. It is usually more desirable to use existing good personnel elsewhere in the organization than to terminate them.</p>

<h3>7. Providing Checks on Performance by Individuals and by Organizational Units</h3>
<p>Assuming that proper results have been defined for individuals and work units, it is the reviewer's responsibility to ensure that adequate checks or measurement criteria have been established to monitor progress towards their achievement. The reviewer must also ascertain that correct performance measures are being used&#8212;not just merely that they exist&#8212;and performance is being compared against them.</p>
