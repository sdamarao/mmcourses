<h2>Some Basic Business Principles</h2>
<p>Each company must determine the basic principles that guide its operations. These principles become the foundation on which the company bases its desirable operational practices. It is these <a title="Glossary Term:Basic business principles" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk809402.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">basic business principles</a> that must be considered in analyzing the company's operations during the conduct of the operational review. Examples of such business principles include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Produce the best quality product at the least possible cost.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Set selling prices realistically, so as to sell the entire product that can be produced within the constraints of the production facilities.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Build trusting relationships with critical vendors; keeping them in business is keeping the company in business.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>The company is in the customer service and cash conversion businesses.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Do not spend a dollar that does not need to be spent; a dollar not spent is a dollar to the bottom line. Control costs effectively; there is more to be made here, than increased sales.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Manage the company; do not let it manage the managers. Provide guidance and direction, not crises.</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Identify the company's customers and develop marketing and sales plans with the customers in mind. Produce for the company's customers, not for inventory. Serve the customers by providing what they need, not by selling them what the company produces.</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>Do not hire employees unless they are absolutely needed; and only when they multiple the company's effectiveness so that the company makes more from them than if they did it themselves.</p>
</li>
<li value="9"><p>Keep property, plant, and equipment to the minimum necessary to maintain customer demand.</p>
</li>
<li value="10"><p>Plan for the realistic, but develop contingency plans for the positive unexpected.</p>
</li>
