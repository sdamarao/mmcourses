<p>Planning provides the focus for the future&#8212;not the guarantee of results. Progress requires change; if you never change, you will never progress.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This chapter discusses the planning phase of an operational review. The planning phase is where the reviewer first learns about the organization's operations through various techniques, such as reviewing planning and budget systems, interviewing, reviewing organizational structure and management, gathering and analyzing information, analyzing financial data and statements, inspecting facilities and work procedures, and so forth. Through the performance of these work steps, the reviewer identifies possible critical operational problem areas to be analyzed in more depth in the fieldwork phase, through the development of an operational review work program. In addition, the proper steps to be taken in the planning phase to ensure successful results from an operational review are fully discussed in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Management's Focus</h2>
<h3>1. Purpose</h3>
<p>The starting point for the operational review is management's decision as to which operational area or areas are to be reviewed, and whether the operational review is to be preliminary or in-depth. Based on management's decision, the operational reviewer then starts the planning phase of the operational review. The primary purposes of the planning phase are to do the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Gather information about the operational area</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Identify possible operational problem areas</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Start to develop the basis for the operational review work program</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The major purpose of a preliminary survey is to identify significant areas for improvement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Working Information</h3>
<p>In the planning phase, general working information on all-important aspects of the organization's operations is obtained in a relatively short time. This is usually accomplished on site, at the company's facilities. If this is a first-time review of this company or a new area of review, the reviewer may need to do some additional on-site research and learning, such as reviewing the company's planning and budget systems and its organizational structure and management.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>3. Deficiencies</h3>
<p>It is important to get this information quickly. The information gathering need not be a long drawn-out process, with laborious readings of manuals and other materials. Time-consuming efforts to show the existence of significant deficiencies should not be undertaken. If any indications of serious deficiencies are found, the reviewer should document them so that they will be considered in deciding on areas for additional work. This procedure provides for an orderly approach to the planning phase and directs operational review effort to those areas with the greatest payout in terms of significant improvement.</p>
<h3>4. 80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>Remember the 80/20 rule. Its application in this case states that 20&#160;percent of the problems impact 80 percent of the organization, and 80 percent of the problems impact only 20 percent of the organization. The reviewer is advised to chase the elephants, the 20 percent, and not the mice, the 80 percent.</p>
<h3>5. Objectives and Controls</h3>
<p>At the end of the planning phase, the reviewer should have adequate working knowledge of the objectives and controls of the reviewed area. The reviewer should be familiar with the organization: its objectives, its problems, its physical layout, and the relative significance of the various responsibilities it has been assigned or has assumed. This enables the reviewer to determine at the outset how much time is required to perform the remaining phases of the review.</p>
</div>
<h1><div id="title"> 
2 B. Information to Be Obtained 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>All of the documents gathered during the planning phase are used to start the permanent files for the operational review. The planning phase can be performed efficiently and systematically if the reviewer has a clear idea of what is needed. The records and information that could be required may include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Laws and regulations that apply to the activities being reviewed</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Material on the organization</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Financial information</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Operating methods and procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Management information and reports</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Problem areas</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Laws and Regulations That Apply to the Activities Being Reviewed</h2>
<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>An understanding of the basic legal authorities governing the area and its activities is needed. The satisfactory performance of an operational review requires that the reviewer ascertain the purpose, scope, and objectives of the activities being reviewed, the way those objectives are to be achieved, and the extent of authority and responsibility conferred. In addition to the basic legislation relating to the area, the reviewer needs to obtain information on important laws that apply to the area or activity, including related regulations and legal decisions. For each law, the reviewer should find out the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Its history and background</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The objectives sought</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The authority vested and the responsibilities imposed to achieve the objectives</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The nature of any restrictions imposed</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Any other significant requirements</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>2. Factors</h3>
<p>In operational reviews in which related legislation is a major consideration, the reviewer should be aware of the following factors:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Management may justify certain activities on the basis of general authority contained in basic laws. Whenever general authority is relied on for conducting an activity, the reviewer obtains complete and clear explanations as to such reliance. The reviewer determines and reports on the extent to which such general authority has been used, and makes full disclosure of unused authority, if significant.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Legislation may impose various restrictions on an organization in carrying out an activity. Compliance with these restrictions is a basic responsibility of management. The reviewer should be familiar with the nature of these restrictions and determine specifically how management provides for ensuring compliance.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Material on the Organization</h2>
<p>The second area in which the reviewer needs to gather information involves the organization and its activities. Primary emphasis should be on the activities that are within the scope of the operational review. This information should include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Division of duties and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Principal delegations of authority</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Nature, size, and location of each operational entity (that is, any field offices)</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Number of employees by organization segment and location</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Nature and location of physical assets and accounting records</p>
</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Among the reviewer's primary concerns is to determine how the company is organized to carry out its functions and how duties and responsibilities are assigned. In addition, the reviewer must determine where the area being reviewed fits into the organizational pattern of the whole company and its relationship to other areas. This knowledge is necessary for a full understanding of the organization's operations.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Financial Information</h2>
<p>The third area of interest to the reviewer is all pertinent financial information, such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Cost of operations by periods</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Year-by-year record of income from revenue-producing operations</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Budget versus actual data for the present and past periods</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Cash flow analysis</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Cost accounting data</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Operating Methods and Procedures</h2>
<p>Normally, the reviewer is more concerned with operating data than with the data typically in a financial statement. A fourth area is investigated to obtain a general description of the organization's operating methods and procedures. The reviewer analyzes and documents the operating methods and procedures by which activities being reviewed are performed. In the planning phase, the reviewer should obtain information as to the general methods and procedures top management prescribes for operating in the area under consideration. In this phase, the review of methods and procedures should not extend below the management level. If it is necessary to get accurate information on which to base a conclusion of how certain systems and procedures actually work, the reviewer may want to talk with a limited number of operations personnel. The information obtained may be generalized and may require further development later in the review to determine the precise methods and procedures at the operating level.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Management Information and Reports</h2>
<p>A fifth category of interest is management information and reports. The reviewer should identify all available management information as well as the nature, content, and timing of all reporting. The reviewer should also look for management information that should be present, but is not. It is extremely important to identify the key operating indicators that management has singled out for reporting purposes and those items subject to exception reporting.</p>
<h2>Problem Areas</h2>
<p>Finally, the reviewer gathers information regarding any problem areas. The reviewer identifies and documents all important problem areas relative to the activities to be reviewed. Areas of major deficiency and those that lend themselves to the greatest improvements are to be emphasized. Remember, these are the items to be pursued in the work program and fieldwork phases. To spend review time most efficiently, it is important to analyze those operational areas with the largest potential payout in terms of improvements. Again, the organization's &#8220;elephants&#8221; should be identified in terms of present problem areas, and the &#8220;mice&#8221; considered only for in-house correction.</p>
</div>
<h1><div id="title"> 
2 C. Sources of Planning Information 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>What are the sources of information to be gathered in the planning phase? Such information could come from various sources; however, the following are the most usual:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Effective interviewing</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Organizational data</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Financial data</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Operating and management reports</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Physical inspection</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Effective Interviewing</h2>
<p>One of the major sources of information about the organization's activities, procedures, and systems is an effective interview. The purpose of the interview is to find out what is going on and why. Interviews in the planning phase should normally be limited to management, to obtain an overview of the operations without becoming involved in the time-consuming details of interviewing the technical personnel more directly engaged in the operation. In practice, limited interviews with operations personnel are usually conducted to ensure that a full and accurate picture is obtained.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Organizational Data</h2>
<p>Organizational data may include such things as copies of organization charts, functional job descriptions, and position charts. The reviewer should be sure to ascertain actual duties, responsibilities, and levels of authority for each individual. Written job descriptions should not be automatically accepted at face value. This could entail talking to selected management and operations personnel and/or having them prepare a description of their perceived job duties and responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Financial Data</h2>
<p>Another source of planning phase information is financial data, such as financial statements over a number of years, budget versus actual reports (present and past), cost of operations by period, revenues year by year by source, cash flow analysis, cost accounting data, and ratio, change, and trend analysis.</p>
<h2>Policies and Procedures</h2>
<p>Existing policies and procedures, which should be documented in procedures manuals, policy pronouncements, directives, and regulations, are yet another source of information. For many small organizations, such materials will probably not exist, except in the heads of management personnel. In this case, the reviewer would then interview these persons to determine what they believe to be existing policies and procedures, and then test them to determine whether they are actually being followed.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Operating and Management Reports</h2>
<p>Further sources of information are operations and management reports, submitted either internally or externally, prior and related review and audit reports and workpapers, and, if available, internal audit and review reports. The reviewer would also determine whether management has responded to any findings identified in these reports and whether any action has been taken.</p>
<h2>Physical Inspection</h2>
<p>Finally, the reviewer makes a physical inspection of the operation, including a tour of all pertinent operational areas and the observation of significant activities being performed. A physical review of the operations area, whenever appropriate, is made relative to the nature of the activities to be examined. The purpose of this physical review is to improve understanding of the activity in physical terms, and to provide support for information about the activity obtained during interviews.</p>
</div>
<h1><div id="title"> 
2 D. Understanding the Organization 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Review of Organizational Planning and Budget Systems</h2>
<p>A good starting point for the reviewer in the planning phase is to understand the organization, why it is in existence, and what it is trying to accomplish (i.e., its goals and objectives). To accomplish this, the reviewer needs to understand the organization's long-term and short-term planning methods and related budgeting and control processes. The reviewer should focus on the organization's approach to planning and its integration with the budgeting process. The organization's planning and budgeting techniques should be a means of achieving improved organizational effectiveness. The reviewer should also be aware of the elements of an effective planning/budgeting system to compare to the practices of the organization under review.</p>
<h2>Strategic Planning</h2>
<p>There should be interaction and interdependence of the strategic (long-term) planning, short-term planning, detail planning, budgeting and monitoring processes. The planning process should be an essential first step in the preparation of an effective budget for the organization. By learning effective planning and budgeting procedures, the reviewer will be able to more effectively review and analyze such procedures as part of her/his organization-wide, departmental, or specific function operational review.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Organizational Structure and Role of Management</h2>
<p>Theoretically, organizations are put together so that the entity can conduct its business more efficiently, and so that the owners and/or top management can multiply their effectiveness (i.e., maximize their desired results). Organizing is intended to be a helping process to enable us to conduct our business better. For many organizations it has become a costly getting-in-the-way process. As part of the planning phase, the operational reviewer must ascertain whether the organization is properly organized or whether improper organization is the cause of its problems.</p>
<h3>1. Organizational Controls</h3>
<p>Adequate organizational control requires that each employee know clearly what her/his role and function is in the organization, and exactly what authority and responsibility have been assigned. It also requires proper separation of duties so that the same individual is not charged with the responsibility for recording and reporting on how a particular task has been accomplished.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>2. Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>Why do organizations in the private and public sectors place more emphasis on the organizational structure of their operations? The answer, in most cases, is because that is how it has always been. If some people were not reporting to other people, they would not know what to do. How could anybody trust them to do their jobs without someone else to watch them? It has become standard procedure to departmentalize people without maintaining individual accountability. When there is trouble within the organization, it is simple to get rid of the entire department or the departmental scapegoat or troublemaker (normally the one who asks the right questions when nobody has good answers), and avoid facing the real cause of the problem. Many times the real problem is ineffective top management. Rather than admit to that, lower-level employees are blamed and let go.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Operational reviews are not designed to eliminate specific employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness</h3>
<p>The real answer why organizations should organize is so that they can accomplish their desired results (be most effective) in the most economical manner (optimum use of limited resources) using the best available methods of operations (be most efficient). This is, of course, the three E&#39;s of operational reviews: economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. If we were able to accomplish the goals of the three E&#39;s (economy, efficiency, and effectiveness) in the first place, and keep things that way, we would not need the quick fixes. Rather than admit our mistakes and make the necessary corrections (i.e., do the right thing), we blame others.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>4. Organizational Structure Examples</h3>
<p>Representative top-level organization charts are shown in Exhibits&#160;2.1 and 2.2. This typical structure would fit most organizations. It is based on hierarchical pyramid concepts where the ultimate power starts at the top and is delegated down through the pyramid. This is a military model. Its purpose is to maintain control within the organization through a chain of command that demands obedience from each level of the organization that reports to a higher level. To this day, many organizations still function in this manner, where the purpose for the organizational hierarchy is to police and control those reporting to them to make sure they do their jobs.</p>
<p><b>(A). Policing and Control</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The structure is also set up with the intrinsic message that those in a higher position on the chart know more. Hence, much of their time is spent on reviewing the work of those under them and then having those under them redo it so it looks more like what the manager would do. It is these policing-and-control-review-and-redo processes that make many supervisors and managers superfluous (non-value added) organizational overhead, and often more hindrance than help.</p>
<p><b>(B). Self-Disciplined Employees</b> &#160;</p>
<p>If these non-value-added processes are eliminated, management is strictly limited to necessities, and the organization creates an atmosphere that encourages the motivation of self-disciplined employee behavior, we can eliminate many of these layers of unnecessary organization.</p>

</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>5. Areas to Review</h3>
<p>Looking at the organization charts, one may have questions and see areas for review related to making this organization more effective and efficient and, as a result, more economical. Some areas to look at include the following:</p>
<table>

<h3>2. Tools</h3>
<p>We use various operational review tools to assist in gathering and analyzing information about the organization. Sample tools include the initial survey form discussed previously and a Job Responsibilities Questionnaire to be filled in by each employee as shown in Exhibit&#160;2.3. Both of these tools are examples of user- or client-provided data, which is to be encouraged, as this minimizes the data gathering time of the operational review team.</p>

2 E. Identification of Critical Problem Areas 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>1. Critical Areas</h3>
<p>Now that needed information has been obtained, how should it be used? The planning data gathered provide the background and general working information for the operational review staff. It should also be used to help decide which specific areas of activity to examine in the fieldwork phase. In most operational reviews, the review staff decides which specific areas to review. The general objective is to direct attention to those matters that most urgently need it. Identifying these critical areas is an important component of each operational review.</p>
<h3>2. Techniques to Identify Critical Problem Areas</h3>
<p>Techniques for preliminary identification of critical problem areas vary with the type of engagement. They require a reviewer's ingenuity and judgment. Such techniques include the following:</p>

<h2>Identification of Key Activities</h2>
<p>The information obtained may disclose key activities or aspects of an activity that appear to be difficult to control or susceptible to abuse or laxity. For instance, in a purchasing operation, the key critical areas might well be the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Determinations of quantities and qualities to be purchased</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Methods used in obtaining the most advantageous price</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Methods of determining whether the correct quantities and qualities are actually received</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Use of Management Reports</h2>
<p>Examining the reports management uses to assure itself that work is progressing within established time and cost goals should provide valuable information in selecting areas of inquiry. Examples of such reporting is operational exception reporting and actual versus plan reporting, which would compare actual results with goals and objectives. The reviewer should look closely at those items management has selected as critical for exception reporting, such as inventory levels, productivity measures, sales analysis, and so on. Indications of critical area to look at will surface if major deviancies are found between the plan and actual results. Keep in mind that the plan could be all right and the operational results critical, or vice versa.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Where such reports are not being used effectively, the reviewer should inquire as to the methods by which control is exercised. This inquiry may point to a lack of effective control with related administrative weakness. It may disclose other less formal control procedures, which may, in turn, disclose operational weaknesses. Similar considerations would apply if proper performance yardsticks have not been established.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Examination of Past Review and Audit Reports</h2>
<p>Past review and audit reports (internal and external) may be a valuable source of information in determining direction of effort. There should be an examination not only of reports prepared by the internal or external review or audit groups, but also of those of other internal review organizations, as well as supervisory groups, where applicable, such as bank examiners. The reviewer should determine whether management agrees with specific review or audit findings, particularly if mentioned by more than one review or audit group, and whether any action has been taken to correct the situation.</p>
<h2>Physical Inspection of the Activities</h2>
<p>A physical inspection of activities requires alertness for signs of ineffectiveness or inefficiency, such as bottlenecks, excess accumulations of equipment or material, and idleness of personnel. Such inspections may disclose serious weaknesses warranting inquiry, or they may depict a pattern prevalent throughout the organization.</p>
<h2>Discussions With Responsible Personnel</h2>
<p>Finally, discussions with responsible officials and personnel directly concerned with the activity may assist in the identification of critical areas. Sometimes, valuable leads can be obtained through discussions with responsible officials and others directly concerned with the activities performed. These individuals can often identify troublesome areas or request that the reviewer look into specific matters that they are concerned about, but for which they lack information regarding the actual conditions.</p>

2 F. Review of Administrative and Operational Controls 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Certain key areas are part of the operational reviewer's review of internal administrative and operational controls in the planning phase. These include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Organization</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Accounting and other records</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Performance standards</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Information systems and internal reports</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Adequate organizational control requires that each employee know clearly what her/his role and function is in the organization, and exactly what authority and responsibility have been assigned. It also requires proper separation of duties so that the same individual is not responsible for recording and reporting on how a particular task has been accomplished.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Policies and Procedures</h2>
<p>Policy sets forth the organization's operating guidelines and specifies what is required, and procedures outline how the policies will be carried out.</p>
<h2>Accounting and Other Records</h2>
<p>The results of business operations must be recorded promptly, accurately, completely, and in conformity with both operating responsibilities and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Accounting and other records must accurately reflect the financial condition of the organization and provide the means for making future business decisions, based on past results.</p>
<h2>Performance Standards</h2>
<p>Performance standards are used to measure results and highlight conditions or trends for management's actions. The reviewer determines the existence and appropriateness of any performance standard established and what actions have been taken.</p>
<h2>Information Systems and Internal Reports</h2>
<p>Major tools in the management control process are information systems and internal reports. They must be economically viable, timely, accurate, concise, and complete. They must provide adequate control over the organization's resources, revenues, and expenditures. That is why appraisal of the effectiveness of internal reports and communications is so important.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>1. Factors</h3>
<p>The task of appraising the effectiveness of internal reports involves determination of the following three factors:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The purpose of the report or the primary communication management intends the report to perform (the intended function)</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The way in which the report affects employees (the actual function)</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The correlation or degree of correspondence between the report's intended effect and the actual effect on the function</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>2. Function</h3>
<p>The reviewer's task is to determine that the intended function and the actual function (how the report's recipient perceives her/his function) are the same. If they are not the same, there is a lack of effective communication. If, on the other hand, such reports are not used, inquiry can be made as to the methods by which control is exercised, which may point to a lack of effective control, with related laxity and administrative weakness.</p>
</div>

2 G. Financial Statement Analysis 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Because members of the operational review team usually have some financial expertise, a good place to start in determining critical operational areas is to analyze the organization's financial data and statements. Keep in mind that financial statements, produced from a financial accounting standpoint, are essentially historical documents that present the organization's assets, liabilities, and equity in a balance sheet and its revenues and expenses in an income statement. These financial statements tell what has happened within the organization during a particular period or series of periods. These same financial statements can be used from an operational review standpoint to help identify present and future critical areas for review. The use of certain analytical tools can effectively help to analyze the financial statements, determine how the organization is doing, and zero in on critical areas that need attention and improvement.</p>
<h2>Comparisons</h2>
<p>Financial statements are primarily static historical documents showing data related only to a specific period of time. Operational reviewers are concerned with the period being reported, and what the trend of events has been and will be over longer periods of time. Accordingly, comparing financial statement data with the results of other periods, or of other organizations, provides a better understanding of trends and helps in making proper decisions as to their relative significance. Comparisons can be made with the historical performance of the company, a competitor's performance, performance of other organizations within the same industry, and organizational goals, objectives, and detail plans.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>1. Benchmarking</h3>
<p>Comparison within the same organization is also known as internal benchmarking, which looks for best results and related best practices. Comparison outside of an organization (competitors, industry, and best in class) is also known as external benchmarking, which looks for best practices that can be incorporated into operations in a program of continuous improvement.</p>
<h3>2. Consistency</h3>
<p>In making comparisons, it is important to be reasonably sure that the data are comparable; that is, that they are calculated on a consistent basis between or among years, companies, and so on. If not, incorrect or misleading conclusions may be drawn, resulting in the expenditure of a substantial amount of operational review time on the wrong functional area.</p>
<h3>3. Formatting</h3>
<p>An initial analytical procedure in financial statement analysis is to format the company's statements comparatively. This may entail comparing this year with last year or comparing a number of years&#39; data, arriving at numerical and/or percentage differences. Preparing statements in such comparative form can disclose valuable information as to present conditions and what to expect about future financial and operating performance.</p>
<h3>4. Horizontal Analysis</h3>
<p>Comparison of two or more years&#39; data is known as horizontal analysis, which identifies changes over time by displaying data changes from year to year in both dollars and percentages. Dollar changes help to identify key factors having an impact on future operations, financial position, or profitability. The Example Company's comparative financial statements for the last three years are shown in Exhibit 2.4. These statements should be reviewed and then the possible critical areas of the Example Company's operations to be considered for operational review should be listed.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>5. Percentage Change</h3>
<p>Looking at changes in percentage between years also assists in providing proper perspective as to changes. For example, a different conclusion is reached when sales increase by $2 million over a previous year's sales of $4 million (a significant increase of 50 percent), than when the previous year's sales were $100 million (an increase of only 2 percent).</p>
<h3>6. Balance Sheet and Income Statement Review</h3>
<p>In the Example Company's Comparative Balance Sheets, there are other examples where the combination of dollar and percentage changes provide a more complete analysis and help to determine a future trouble spot. For instance, an accounts receivable increase from $1,600 in XXX8 to $1,900 in XXX9 does not appear too critical; however, expressed as an 18-percent increase (and as 7 percent of sales of $12,500), it takes on greater significance. As seen in the Example Company's Comparative Income Statements, sales increased by $500,000 from XXX7 to XXX8; however, cost of goods sold also increased by $500,000 exactly offsetting the change in sales and adding nothing to profitability.</p>

<h3>2. Trend Percentages</h3>
<p>Financial statement analysis can also be accomplished through the use of trend percentages, which are used to state a number of years&#39; financial data in terms of a base year. The rule in using trend percentages is that at least three data points need to be examined before a trend can be identified.</p>
<p><b>Example 2.1&#8212;Trend Percentages</b> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Consider the Example Company:</i> &#160;</p>
<div style="margin-top:14px;">
<table class="lt" width="400">
<tr>
    <th align="center">&#160;</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;XXX9</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;XXX8</th>
    <th align="right">XXX7</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sales</td>
    <td align="right">$12,500</td>
    <td align="right">$11,000</td>
    <td align="right">$10,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Net Income</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;1,200</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;900</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;900</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p><i>Analyzing the dollar data alone, it could be concluded that both sales and net income have increased over the three-year period. However, it cannot readily be concluded how fast sales have increased and whether the increases in net income have kept pace with sales increases. Using dollar data alone may make it difficult to conclude adequately. Now, assume that the base year XXX7 is equal to 100 percent; the other years can be stated as a percentage of the base year:</i> &#160;</p>
<div style="margin-top:14px;">
<table class="lt" width="550">
<tr>
    <th align="center">&#160;</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;&#160;XXX9</th>
    <th align="center">&#160;&#160;XXX8</th>
    <th align="right">XXX7</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&#160;</td>
    <td align="right">Dollars%</td>
    <td align="right">Dollars%</td>
    <td align="right">Dollars%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sales</td>
    <td align="right">$12,500119%</td>
    <td align="right">$11,000105%</td>
    <td align="right">$10,500100%</td>

<tr>
    <td>Net Income</td>
    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;1,200133%</td>

    <td align="right">$&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;900100%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p><i>By using these trend percentages as well as the differences in real dollars (or numbers), the increase in sales and net income can be put into proper perspective. It can now be clearly seen that the relative growth in sales has been surpassed by the growth in net income; sales in XXX9 are 19 percent greater than the base year, but net income is 33 percent greater. Note also that sales growth was better than net income growth in XXX8, and that the growth in sales in XXX9 over XXX8 was considerably below the growth in net income for the same year. Such an analysis could indicate major operational areas for review, such as sales analysis, cost of goods sold analysis, selling price procedures, and cost analysis.</i> &#160;</p>

<h3>3. Common-Size Statements</h3>
<p>A common-size financial statement shows the line items as percentages in addition to absolute dollars. Each line item on the financial statements is shown as a percentage of some total, such as assets or sales. The preparation and presentation of common-size statements is known as &#8220;vertical analysis,&#8221; revealing changes in the relative significance of each line item. An analysis of financial statements on a common-size basis could disclose such areas as shown in Example 2.2.</p>

<h3>2. Priority Areas for Improvement</h3>
<p>Although all of the operational areas recommended for operational review should produce beneficial results and adequate payout, the Example Company's management has decided to review the purchasing function first. Their rationale is that purchasing is responsible for the economy of operations related to additions to inventory; manufacturing material costs; additions to property, plant and equipment; expediting on-time vendor deliveries; and overall vendor relations. Because the Example Company has become increasingly material dependent in its manufacturing operations, with resultant increases in inventory, this does appear to be a good place to start. In addition, the initial survey disclosed that the purchasing department systems and procedures were antiquated and quite ineffective.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Areas Not Selected for Review</h2>
<p>The other operational areas for which it is determined that additional operational review work will not be performed at this time are not to be merely put aside. They should all be mentioned to organizational and departmental management in an oral and/or written report, recommending further action, such as the following:</p>
<h3>1. Immediate Action</h3>
<p>For example, facility changes to be made so that buyers have privacy when talking with vendors and a set schedule established for vendor appointments</p>
<h3>2. Further Analysis and Review by Organizational and Departmental Management</h3>
<p>For example, management might consider changing the purchasing department reporting to the Vice President of Operations, as well as other conflicting units such as inspections, inventory control, and warehouse</p>
<h3>3. Future Operational Review by Operational Review Team or Internal Departmental Personnel</h3>
<p>For example, the review of special approval procedures, such as capital expenditures, over budget limitations, and special projects</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a result of the work steps conducted in the planning phase as described above, a properly indexed and organized planning phase workpaper file should have been developed for all the materials gathered and work steps performed. The workpaper file is used as a resource in developing the indepth work program and the corresponding fieldwork. A number of critical operating areas should also have been developed where more in-depth review procedures need to be performed in the work program phase leading toward development of a significant operational review finding.</p>
<h3>1. Example Areas</h3>

<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>2. Work Program</h3>
<p>The in-depth operational review work program should also have been started. Based on the identification of possible critical operational areas, each member on the review team should have begun thinking about and have documented suggested work steps to be incorporated into the in-depth work program. This is the starting point for developing the operational review work program. The steps required for its finalization are discussed in Chapter 3. Before continuing, review the operational review situation &#8220;Purchase Order Quantity Tolerances&#8221; (Example 2.3) as an example of what you might encounter in the planning phase.</p>
<p><b>Example 2.3&#8212;Purchase Order Quantity Tolerances</b> &#160;</p>
<p><i>During the planning phase of an operational review, the reviewer found in reviewing the Purchasing Department's methods and procedures that vendors could be allowed to ship the ordered quantity plus or minus 10 percent. However, this practice was approved only for certain commodities such as nuts, bolts, wire, and rope.</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>During physical inspection of the Purchasing Department and discussions with the manager of the Purchasing Department as part of the planning phase of the operational review, the reviewer found that:</i> &#160;</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The 10-percent quantity tolerance was being used for items that didn't require a tolerance, such as office supplies, maintenance items, cleaning supplies, etc.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Most vendors took advantage of the tolerance terms and shipped the ordered quantity plus 10 percent.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Procedures existed relative to such purchase order tolerances; however, each buyer decided what was appropriate based on knowledge of industry practice.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b><i>Questions and Solutions for Consideration:</i></b> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Q. What additional steps might the reviewer want to perform in the planning phase relative to this situation?</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>A. Time-consuming efforts to show the existence of significant deficiencies should not be undertaken. Accordingly, this situation should only be documented at this point, for consideration when deciding on areas for additional work.</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Q. What could the reviewer suggest, if anything, to the Purchasing Department to correct the situation at this point?</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>A. Written instructions should be prepared for each buyer stating the specific items that require tolerance and the level of tolerance to be used.</i> &#160;</p>
<p><i>Note that the institution of such written instructions, and exercise of granting such purchase tolerances only to those items requiring it, resulted in a net annual savings of approximately $320,000 for the Example Company.</i> &#160;</p>

2 I. Case Study: Joe Sorry, Inc. 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Areas to Be Reviewed</h2>
<p>The starting point for the operational review of Joe Sorry, Inc. is Joe and Flo's decision as to which operational area or areas to be reviewed. As was discussed and documented in the proposal letter, the general areas to be reviewed were agreed to be the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Personnel: manufacturing, general, and administrative</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Manufacturing operations</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Product line analysis</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Profit center concepts</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Operational reporting considerations</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Planning and budget systems</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Organization Review</h2>
<p>The original organization for Joe Sorry, Inc. was primarily Joe and Flo with contract labor hired as needed. The organization structure while simple exemplifies many of the principles of proper organization such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Clear lines of authority</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Proper division of duties and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Communication between functions, across functions, upward, and downward</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Minimal use of personnel and then only as needed</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Proper delegation of responsibility and authority</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Management able to effectively control the sphere of their operations and results</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Management and other personnel clearly understanding what is expected of them and the results to be achieved</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>Organization established based on the principles of the three E&#39;s&#8212;economy, efficiency, and effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li value="9"><p>The right size organization for what needs to be accomplished</p>
</li>
<li value="10"><p>Minimal levels of non-value added employees and management</p>
</li>
<li value="11"><p>Organization no larger than it has to be to accomplish results</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Tour of Facilities</h2>
<p>The first thing I did upon arriving to conduct the planning phase of the operational review at Joe's business, which was now located in a fancy new industrial park in an upward mobile suburban area, was to take a tour of his operations. Joe took me around, proud of what he had accomplished&#8212;over 10,000 square feet of production space with 50 production employees, and 3,000 feet of office space with over 30 employees. I asked Joe to leave and let me mosey around the facilities, while he returned to the crisis of the day. The following is what I found out by walking around and talking with the employees on my own:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The 50 production employees were separated into 6 teams of seven employees each, with one team member assigned the role of team leader. Although the team leader received a minimal amount of additional pay, not one of them was comfortable exercising their team leader responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Each of the 6 teams was assigned a foreperson, who was responsible for pushing and maximizing production. Only one of the forepersons was &#8220;respected&#8221; by her team, and that was only because she left them alone to do their jobs.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>The production teams were divided into 4 groups by type of product. Joe had increased from strictly a producer of specialty boards to a diversified product line as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Specialty boards for a constant customer base: 1 team</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Custom boards as requested by customers: 1 team</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Defense contractors on a contract basis: 2 teams</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Basic boards on a competitive basis to any and all customers: 2 teams. These basic boards were purchased from an offshore producer, and Joe's employees checked them, provided add-ons, and Joe's identification materials.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The other two production employees were a Vice-President of Production responsible for Production Control and Scheduling and an Inventory Control Manager responsible for ensuring that sufficient materials were on-hand to meet production needs. Idle teams due to material stock-outs were forbidden.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(F)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>In addition, I found that there were also 12 additional employees that Joe considered indirect labor or overhead (neither plant nor office). These included the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Five repair and maintenance employees who were responsible for maintaining equipment and cleaning the facilities in the plant and office&#8212;who appeared to be doing mainly &#8220;busy work.&#8221;</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(2)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Four packers and shippers, and three receivers. Both units appeared to work sporadically, and at other times got in the way of the production people.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Review of the Office Functions</h2>
<p>When I went to find Joe, he was in the midst of his next crisis, so I wandered around the office area and talked with those personnel I was able to catch in their offices. The following is what I found out on my quick review tour of the office area:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The office and its 30 employees was divided into the following functions:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Sales: 12 employees; a sales manager for each product line&#8212;in effect Joe was in four businesses, with 8 salespeople assigned as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Specialty boards: 2 sales people</p>
</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Defense business: 2 sales people</p>

    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(4)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Basic boards: 3 sales people</p>

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Engineering Department: 9 employees; 6 engineers (one head engineer) and 3 draftspeople; with Joe unofficially functioning as &#8220;Engineering Manager.&#8221;</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Accounting Department: 5 employees; a CFO/Controller, an employee each assigned to Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Payroll, and General Ledger.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Purchasing: 4 employees; a Purchasing Manager and 3 purchasing agents/buyers</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Every employee in the office had a computer networked into a central file server. Other than the above functions, I found three other PCs in the office area&#8212;two for word processing and one for a spreadsheet application.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Other Functions Using Office Space</h2>
<p>In addition I found the following functions, not included as production or office, but occupying office space:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Quality Control (really a production function, but housed in the office area): 7 employees; a QC Manager and 6 QC inspectors&#8212;one assigned to each production team (whether they needed it or not).</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Customer Service: 3 employees; a manager and two others; who spent their day dealing with customer calls and complaints&#8212;mainly late deliveries and after sale issues.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Personnel: 2 employees: a Personnel Manager and one assistant.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Joe's Office: which included himself as President/CFO and 3 Assistants to the President (who turned out to be troubleshooters for the crises that Joe could not handle).</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Vice-President's Office: for Flo (who rarely appeared) and two assistants. Formal title: Vice President of Operations.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Clerical Staff: 24 employees; 4 each for sales and accounting, 3 each for engineering and purchasing, 2 each for customer service, personnel, and quality control, 1 each for Joe and Flo, plus 2 receptionists.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Review of Organization and Employees</h2>
<p>Instead of the 80 or so employees Joe had claimed, there were actually over 130 (not including Joe and Flo), with as many office personnel controlling and supporting production operations. It was apparent that Joe had created a corporate empire, almost rivaling his former employer. I compared the original organization for Joe's initial &#8220;garage shop&#8221; business to the one I prepared for the present organization. The differences were not only staggering, but also Joe and the company were out of control. Joe's organization chart now looked like a camel (that is, a horse created by a committee). The organization had grown based on immediate crisis rather than on proper organizational principles. Quick review and analysis of the current organization showed some possible inefficiencies and organizational roadblocks, such as the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Instead of Joe and Flo handling all of the major functions, they now had 135 employees.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Gross payroll was now over $3,010,000. Compared to the present level of $6,250,000 in gross sales, this represents over 48 percent of sales. Even at this relatively high level, the company was able to earn $830,000 or 13.3 percent of sales.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Questionable staff personnel such as the following:</p>

<h2>Analysis of Initial Survey Form</h2>
<p>One of the first steps in the planning phase is to analyze the organization's responses to an initial survey form, such as the one shown in Exhibit 2.5.</p>
<p>Exhibit 2.5 Operational Review Initial Survey Form is available as a pdf supplement through this link and Tools.</p>
<h3>1. Planning and Budgeting</h3>
<p>There are no real planning systems in place. The only defined goal is to be the biggest possible in terms of sales and income, which may create a conflict. In the absence of effective planning systems, the budget system does not integrate with the company's plans, but is merely a broad projection for the next year (based on Joe's wishes rather than any reality) compared on a monthly basis by the controller.</p>
<h3>2. Personnel and Staffing</h3>
<p>The organization is growing out of control. It appears that there are too many employees in almost every function, with a good possibility that instead of providing increased efficiency, they often get in everyone else's way. Many employees do not seem to know exactly what they should be doing; there is possibly more filling of time than achievement of desired results. Personnel hiring, orientation, training, supervision, evaluation, promotion, and firing practices have to be reviewed and greatly improved; there is too much control by Joe and the department managers.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>3. Management</h3>
<p>Top management is really Joe&#8212;not effectively delegating. Flo has almost disappeared from the operations of the company. The Production Manager, although given authority over production, is continually being overridden by Joe. Middle management appears to be operating under similar conditions&#8212;that is, controlled by Joe. An effective management and operating reporting system does not exist. There is a need for delegating down to the lowest possible levels and keeping Joe from interfering with everyone's operations.</p>
<h3>4. Policies and Procedures</h3>
<p>No formal policies or procedures exist. This is causing great confusion overall within the organization and within most of the departments. There is too much control by management, with capricious changes by management making it difficult for employees to sense any consistency.</p>
<h3>5. Computer Processing</h3>
<p>There are personal computers in every department, one in almost every employee's workstation. Many are not being used at all; some are used minimally, others are used for packaged software applications. This area needs to be reviewed and analyzed to determine how an effective management and operating reporting system can be implemented.</p>
<h3>6. Manufacturing Systems</h3>
<p>Although there is a computerized manufacturing system for production and inventory control, it appears that it is being used ineffectively, mainly for routing customer orders through production and reporting inventory reorders (based on reorder points and reorder quantities) and on-hand inventory balances. The software is used to support ineffective manufacturing processes.</p>
<h3>7. Responsibility and Authority</h3>
<p>Responsibilities have not been clearly defined, so most employees do not know what they should be doing and what is expected of them. Although authority has been somewhat delegated to middle managers, Joe through his continual interference has sabotaged it.</p>

<h2>Identification of Critical Areas for Review</h2>
<p>A good method to use in identifying critical areas for review is to have the review team staff record each possible area as they work through the preliminary survey and the planning phase. At the end of the planning phase, the review team members critique the list accumulated and combine like items, eliminate unnecessary or less critical items, and then prioritize the remaining items. The review team's list of critical areas for review is shown in Exhibit 2.6.</p>
