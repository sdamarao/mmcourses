<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of this course is to help you understand the basic principles involved in planning and conducting an operational review directed toward the continual implementation of best practices in an organized program of continuous improvements. In addition, it will provide the information and fundamentals to use operational review concepts to enable you to operate most economically, efficiently, and effectively&#8212;that is, to maximize operating results at the least cost, using the most efficient methods.</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Management, supervisors, and other employees who desire to perform operational reviews for their operational areas of responsibility can use the materials presented in this course. In addition, others can use the tools and techniques presented&#8212;such as internal and external consultants and auditors&#8212;to maintain operations in the most economical, efficient, and effective manner.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>In today's many-faceted and multi-disciplined economic environment, organizational management has placed an increasing emphasis on increasing results with fewer resources through the evaluation of the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the organization's operations. The operational review is the tool used to perform such an evaluation&#8212;individually or as part of another procedure, such as benchmarking, activity-based management, Total Quality Management (TQM), reengineering, and so on. This course presents the basic principles of planning and conducting such an operational review as well as the fundamentals of which the reviewer must be aware, to understand operational review concepts.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Why Businesses Are in Existence</h2>
<p>A starting point for establishing operational review measurement criteria is to decide which businesses the organization is really in so that operational efficiencies and effectiveness can be compared to such overall organizational criteria. Before one even thinks about performing an operational review of an organization, it is necessary to determine why the organization is in existence. When clients are asked this question, invariably the answer is to make money. Although this is partly true, there are really only two reasons for a business entity to exist.</p>
<h3>1. The Customer Service Business</h3>
<p>The first reason an organization exists is to provide goods and services to satisfy desired customers, so that they will continue to use the business's goods and services and refer it to others. An organizational philosophy that correlates with this goal that has been found to be successful is &#8220;to provide the highest quality products and service at the least possible cost.&#8221;</p>
<h3>2. The Cash Conversion Business</h3>
<p>Another reason an organization exists is to create desired goods and services so that the investment in the business is as quickly converted to cash as possible, with the resultant cash-in exceeding the cash-out (net profits or positive return on investment). The correlating philosophy to this goal can be stated as follows: &#8220;To achieve desired business results using the most efficient methods so that the organization can optimize the use of limited resources.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Being in the customer service and cash conversion businesses enables the company to make money and to survive.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>3. Businesses Not to Be in</h3>
<p>Once short-term thinking is eliminated, managers realize they are not in the following businesses and decision making becomes simpler:</p>
<p><b>(A). Sales Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Making sales that cannot be collected profitably (sales are not profits until the cash is received and all the costs of the sale are less than the amount collected) creates only numerical growth.</p>
<p><b>(B). Customer Order Backlog Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Logging customer orders is a paperwork process to impress internal management and outside shareholders. Unless this backlog can be converted into a timely sale and collection, there is only a future promise, which may never materialize.</p>
<p><b>(C). Accounts Receivable Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Get the cash as quickly as possible, not the promise to pay. Remember, customers are the company's business; keeping them in business is keeping the company in business. Normally, the company has already put out its cash to vendors and/or into inventory. It may even be desirable to get out of the accounts receivable business all together. This is particularly true for small sales where the amount of the sale is less than the cost of billing and collections or where major customers (e.g., 20 percent of all customers equal 80 percent of total sales) are willing to pay at the time of shipping or receipt as part of price negotiations.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b>(D). Inventory Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Inventory does not equal sales. Keep inventories to a minimum&#8212;zero if possible. Procure raw materials from vendors only as needed, produce for real customer orders based on agreed upon delivery dates, maximize work-in-process throughput, and ship directly from production when the customer needs the product. To accomplish these inventory goals, it is necessary to develop an effective organizational life stream that includes vendors, employees, and customers.</p>
<p><b>(E). Property, Plant, and Equipment Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Maintain at a minimum: be efficient. Idle plant/equipment causes anxiety and results in inefficient use. If it is there, it will be used. Plan for the normal (or small valleys) not for the maximum (or large peaks); network to outsource for additional capacity and in-source for times of excess capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b>(F). Employment Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Get by with the least number of employees as possible. Never hire an additional employee unless absolutely necessary; learn how to cross train and transfer good employees. Not only do people cost ongoing salaries and fringe benefits, but they also need to be paid attention to&#8212;as any excesses in personnel results in unnecessary and costly organization building.</p>
<p><b>(G). Management and Administration Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The more an organization has, the more difficult it becomes to manage its business. It is easier to work with less and be able to control operations than to spend time managing the managers. So much of management becomes getting in the way of those it is supposed to manage and meeting with other managers to discuss how to do this. Management becomes the promotion for doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Knowing the businesses not to be in keeps the company in the businesses it should be in&#8212;and to grow and prosper.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Some Basic Business Principles</h2>
<p>Each company must determine the basic principles that guide its operations. These principles become the foundation on which the company bases its desirable operational practices. It is these basic business principles that must be considered in analyzing the company's operations during the conduct of the operational review. Examples of such business principles include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Produce the best quality product at the least possible cost.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Set selling prices realistically, so as to sell the entire product that can be produced within the constraints of the production facilities.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Build trusting relationships with critical vendors; keeping them in business is keeping the company in business.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>The company is in the customer service and cash conversion businesses.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Do not spend a dollar that does not need to be spent; a dollar not spent is a dollar to the bottom line. Control costs effectively; there is more to be made here, than increased sales.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Manage the company; do not let it manage the managers. Provide guidance and direction, not crises.</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>Identify the company's customers and develop marketing and sales plans with the customers in mind. Produce for the company's customers, not for inventory. Serve the customers by providing what they need, not by selling them what the company produces.</p>
</li>
<li value="8"><p>Do not hire employees unless they are absolutely needed; and only when they multiple the company's effectiveness so that the company makes more from them than if they did it themselves.</p>
</li>
<li value="9"><p>Keep property, plant, and equipment to the minimum necessary to maintain customer demand.</p>
</li>
<li value="10"><p>Plan for the realistic, but develop contingency plans for the positive unexpected.</p>
</li>

<h2>Organizational Basics</h2>
<h3>1. Criteria For Organizational Growth</h3>
<p>There are numerous criteria organizations may choose to implement in their programs of continuous improvement leading toward organizational growth. As part of conducting an operational review, the reviewer must be aware of these criteria to be successful in addressing the company's desired direction&#8212;in total or by business segment or function. Some of these criteria include the following:</p>

<h3>2. Mental Models And Belief Systems</h3>
<p>Many organizations operate on the basis of prevalent mental models or belief systems&#8212;usually emanating from past and present top management&#8212;which have an overriding effect on the conditions with which operations within the company are carried out. They can help to produce a helpful working environment or atmosphere or a hindering one. In effect, such mental models become performance drivers&#8212;those elements within the organization that shape the direction of how employees will perform their functions. Examples of such mental models and belief systems include the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Hard work and doing what you are told are the keys to success for the individual and the company.</p>

<h3>3. Organizational Criteria Results Structure</h3>
<p>The first step in successful operational review planning is to define the company's desired criteria for results as related to their reasons for existence, basic business principles, mental models, belief systems, performance drivers, and so on. These organizational criteria typically encompass the company as an entity as well as its major functions. An example of such an organizational results criteria structure is as follows:</p>
<p><b>(A). Organization-Wide Criteria</b> &#160;</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>

<h3>2. Helpful Systems</h3>
<p>Operational reviews, together with other techniques, are tools to make these systems helpful as intended and direct organizations toward their goals. Theoretically, organizations should operate in an economic, efficient, and effective manner at all times. If such were the case, operational review techniques would be applied on an ongoing basis; however, with the passage of time, good intentions and initially helpful systems tend to deteriorate. Operational reviews are then necessary to help get the organization back on the right track by pinpointing operational deficiencies, developing practical recommendations, and implementing positive changes.</p>
<h3>3. Accountability</h3>
<p>Managers at all levels should be held accountable for using the scarce resources entrusted to them to achieve maximum results at the least possible costs. Although management should embrace operational review concepts and apply them as they proceed, this is rarely the case. More typically, management needs to be sold on the value of operational reviews. In selling the benefits of conducting operational reviews, it is important to stress that, unlike other techniques that cost time and money for uncertain results, operational reviews pay for themselves. In effect, the operational review environment becomes a profit center instead of a cost center.</p>

<h2>The Operational Reviewer</h2>
<p>An operational review can be performed by anyone with the appropriate skills; however, internal and/or external consultants, because of their knowledge of the operations and their analytical skills, are typically requested to perform such services. In some organizations, a separate operational review unit trained in operational review concepts is established. The most effective way in which to implement such procedures is to assign overall responsibility for implementing organization-wide operational review procedures, which would include the performance of operational reviews as well as training operations personnel in implementing these techniques in their areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>1. Attributes</h3>
<p>The progress and ultimate success in achieving the benefits of operational reviews depend greatly on the reviewers&#39; skills and what management and others think of them. Those assigned to an operational review engagement must possess the ability to review and analyze financial, management, and operational areas. The attributes of an effective operational reviewer include the following:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The ability to spot the trouble areas&#8212;to look at a given situation and quickly determine what is getting in the way</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The application of the 80/20 rule states that operational reviews require 80 percent common sense and 20 percent technical expertise; and that 80 percent of the trouble areas cause 20 percent of the problems, and that 20 percent causes 80 percent of the problems.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The success of an operational review is measured by the degree with which recommendations are implemented, and implementation is a direct by-product of effective communication.

</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>3. Operational Review Skills and Abilities</h3>
<p>The attributes of an effective operational reviewer would be helpful to any manager. While managers should have analytical ability, they may use it primarily to perform repetitive tasks. Operational reviewers, on the other hand, use these skills and abilities to assess a user's situations and recommend positive operational improvements.</p>
<p><b>(A). Balance</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The difference between required attributes for operational personnel and operational reviewers is similar to the difference between the left brain and the right brain. The left brain, which controls thinking and calculation processes, is more important to operations personnel performing repetitive tasks; whereas the right brain, which controls creativity and perceptual skills, is more critical to the operational reviewer. Basically, the operational reviewer needs a good balance of both, yet with a greater emphasis on the creative and perceptual side. This is why the best manager or operating personnel does not always make the best operational reviewer and why things tend to stay the same.</p>
<p><b>(B). Analytical Techniques</b> &#160;</p>
<p>To render effective services, the operational reviewer must have substantial knowledge of the total environment of the organization being examined and a high degree of skill and experience with the analytical techniques and tools needed to solve problems. The operational reviewer should also have sensitivity to, and understanding of, the values and goals of all the various people that make up a going concern.</p>
<p><b>(C). Problem Identification and Analytical Skills</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Someone trained in operating systems and procedures need not spend many years learning new methods before engaging in operational reviews, as the basic techniques are the same. They mainly need to sharpen the problem identification and analytical skills they already possess. Operational reviews can be viewed as 80 percent practical analysis and common sense and 20 percent technical know-how.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b>(D). Review Techniques</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The operational review requires the reviewer to possess a number of varied tools and techniques. The following are included among these review techniques:</p>

<h3>4. Recommendations</h3>
<p>Success as an effective operational reviewer is based on what is accomplished; that is, recommendations made to management that are subsequently implemented. Operational reviews should be fascinating and rewarding to the reviewer as well as operations personnel. The individual's stature as an operational reviewer, credibility of the entire review staff, management and others&#39; positive regard of the review staff all will increase in proportion to the degree of success attained in the operational review.</p>
<h3>5. Functional Disciplines</h3>
<p>Because of the number of different types and complexities of operational reviews and the varying skills required, supporting functional disciplines are often necessary to supplement the regular review staff's skills and abilities. It is not always practical to maintain personnel with all of the required skills on the operational review staff. One should consider the skills that are necessary for the successful conduct of each operational review, and either make sure that such skills are available on staff or contract for needed outside expertise.</p>

</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Operational review is a widely used term encompassing many aspects and techniques; however, no uniform, commonly recognized definition has been unanimously accepted. The definitions that have been given for operational reviews include the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>An extension of the audit function into all operations of a business</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>The application of internal auditing to operations rather than financial controls</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>The identification of opportunities for greater efficiency and economy, or to improve effectiveness in carrying out operational procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>A control technique for evaluating the effectiveness of operating procedures</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Nothing more than a review of controls, now including nonfinancial controls</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Review of activities other than those pertaining to examination of financial data</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Combining definitions, it could be said that operational review is a review of operations performed from a management viewpoint to evaluate the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of any and all operations, limited only by management's desires.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Operational Review Concepts</h2>
<h3>1. Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>Operational review can be defined as a process for analyzing internal operations and activities to identify areas for positive improvement in a program of continuous improvement. The process begins with an analysis of existing operations and activities, identifies areas for positive improvement, and then establishes a performance standard upon which the activity can be measured. The goal is to improve each identified activity so that it can be the best possible and stay that way. The best practice is not always measured in terms of least costs, but may be more what stakeholders&#39; value and expected levels of performance.</p>
<h3>2. The Customer</h3>
<p>Operational review processes are directed towards the continuous pursuit of positive improvements, excellence in all activities, and the effective use of best practices. The focal points in achieving these goals are the customers, both internal and external. They establish performance expectations and are the ultimate judges of quality. A company customer is defined as anyone who has a stake or interest in the ongoing operations of the organization, such as the following:</p>

    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Customers/end users: external</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>3. The Company</h3>
<p>Operational review results provide the company (i.e., owners, management, and employees) with data necessary for effective resource allocation and the strategic focus for the organization. The operational review process provides for those objective measures to determine the success of the company's internal goals, objectives, and detail plans as well as competitive performance measures. Evaluating the company's performance against stakeholder expectations enables the company to pursue its program of continuous improvement and the road to excellence. Effective operational review procedures encompass both internal and external needs.</p>
<h3>4. The Manager</h3>
<p>Managers who are responsible for an operational area have traditionally maintained the operation as they found it; that is, they primarily accepted the organization, personnel, and functions they inherited. They were not allowed or did not understand how to make their assigned area of responsibility more efficient. Many times, there were systems in effect (such as over-controlling bosses) that prevented such positive changes.</p>
<h3>5. Operational Viewpoint</h3>
<p>The purpose of the operational review is to assist managers and operations personnel to look at their areas of responsibility from an operational viewpoint. What do we mean when we say &#8220;from an operational viewpoint&#8221;? We mean that operations are viewed with an eye to whether one can improve operations to be performed more efficiently, effectively, or economically. Many times, the managers and employees of an operational area are too close to operations, are too resistant to change, are too enmeshed in daily operations, and so on to objectively review their own operations. Since, both internal and external consultants have the fact-finding and diagnostic skills needed to perform such operational reviews, they are frequently asked to do so. In some organizations, a separate unit is formed strictly to perform operational reviews.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>6. Intent of the Operational Review</h3>
<p>The intent of the operational review is not to be critical of present operations but to review operations and develop a program of best practices and continuous positive operational improvements by working with management and staff personnel. This can be accomplished most effectively by working with operations personnel in areas where they recognize deficiencies and are willing to cooperate. The concept of operational reviews should be sold as an internal program of review directed toward improved economies and efficiencies that will produce increased operational results.</p>
<h3>7. Quality of Operations</h3>
<p>Operational reviewing got its start when management stopped being concerned solely with reviewing reported information, and started wondering why a transaction was made in the first place and if there was a better way to do it. Operational review is the process whereby the reviewer determines whether management is using the resources entrusted to them in the most economical and efficient manner, to achieve the most effective results of operations. The focus and scope of operations have changed in recent years. Management has increased demands for more relevant information regarding the conduct of its operations and related results than can be found in strictly financial data. Management seeks information with which to judge the quality of operations and make operational improvements. That is why operational review techniques are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness</h2>
<p>Operational review procedures embrace the concept of conducting operations for economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. The following is a brief description of each of the &#8220;three Es of operational reviews.&#8221;</p>
<h3>1. Economy&#8212;the Cost of Operations</h3>
<p>Is the organization carrying out its responsibilities in the most economical manner (i.e., through due conservation of its resources)? In appraising the economy of operations, and related allocation and use of resources, the reviewer may consider whether the organization is:</p>

<h3>3. Economy and Efficiency</h3>
<p>Economy and efficiency are both relative terms, and it is not possible to determine whether the area under review has reached the maximum practicable level of either.

In performing this part of the review, the reviewer evaluates cost minimization, emphasizing reduction of costs, but not to the point where results are not accomplished. In addition, productivity maximization may be analyzed, but not to the point where the costs become excessive. In evaluating economy and efficiency, the reviewer analyzes the use of resources such as people, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money. For example, the reviewer might analyze the following:</p>

<h3>5. Operational Review Triangle</h3>
<p>The three Es of operational review&#8212;economy, efficiency, and effectiveness&#8212;or what may be referred to as operational review triangle are graphically presented in Exhibit 1.1.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The operational review process typically starts by analyzing the organizations planning systems&#8212;that is, to determine the agreed upon reasons why the organization is in existence and the related goals and objectives established by management to move them effectively in those directions. The budget system is looked at as the manifestation of the planning process by allocating scarce resources to the achievement of planning systems goals and objectives&#8212;encompassing the three Es.</p>

<h2>Why Perform an Operational Review</h2>
<p>What are some of the reasons an operational review should be performed? The focus and scope of many operations have changed in recent years. Management has increased demands for more relevant information on the conduct of their operations and the related results than can be found solely in financial data. Both business and government management seek more information with which to judge the quality of operations and make operational improvements. That is why we need operational review techniques to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.</p>
<h3>1. General Purpose</h3>
<p>An operational review involves a systematic review of an organization's activities in relation to specified objectives. The general purposes of the operational review could be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><b>(A). Assess Performance</b> &#160;</p>
<p>To assess performance is to compare the way an organization conducts its activities with: objectives established by management, such as organizational policies, standards, goals, objectives and detail plans; comparisons to other similar functions or individuals within the organization (internal benchmarking); and comparisons to other organizations (external benchmarking).</p>
<p><b>(B). Identify Opportunities for Improvement</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Increased economy, efficiency, or effectiveness is the broad categories under which most improvements are classified. The reviewer may identify specific opportunities for improvement (best practices) by analyzing interviews with individuals (within or outside of the organization), observing operations, reviewing past and current operational data, analyzing transactions, making internal and external comparisons, and exercising professional judgment based on experience with the organization or others.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b>(C). Develop Recommendations for Improvement or Further Action</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The nature and extent of recommendations developed in the course of operational reviews vary considerably. In many cases, the reviewer may be able to make specific recommendations. In other cases, further study not within the scope of the review may be required. The reviewer should be continually looking for best practices (both internal and external) in a program for continuous improvements.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>It seems that operations personnel would be involved in establishing and implementing recommendations. In most instances, such procedures are set by management, causing operations personnel to resist them. This works against them being successful. Organization structure tends to evolve over time, with minimal regard to economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Incentives</h3>
<p>In most organizations there are built-in incentives to increase organizational levels such as budget systems that reward larger organizations and politicking to build empires. It is the reviewer's role to identify such organizational inefficiencies and to recommend improvements. When the reviewers do this, they do not put themselves in the position of recommending specific individual cuts. Assuming that the organization's personnel are all good employees (and hiring, orientation, training, and promotion policies and procedures are adequate), the reviewer may recommend achieving desired results with less overall personnel. It is, then, management's responsibility to decide what to do with extraneous personnel; such as departmental transfers, retraining, lateral moves, etc. It is usually more desirable to be able to use existing good personnel somewhere else in the organization, than to terminate them.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>3. Specific Objectives</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why management desires to have an operational review performed. Keep in mind that management may be looking for a single objective (e.g., operational efficiency), a combination of objectives (e.g., least cost but most efficient systems, best practices), or their own specific agenda (e.g., achievement of results on the basis of cost versus benefits). Some specific objectives are as follows:</p>

<h2>Benefits of Operational Reviews</h2>
<p>Depending on its scope, an operational review can be of significant benefit to top management and staff, in some or all of the following ways:</p>
<h3>1. Identifying Problem Areas, Related Causes, and Alternatives for Improvement</h3>
<p>This is a major purpose of operational reviews. Although often aware of a problem, management cannot always define exactly its dimensions. The reviewer's third-party objective viewpoint helps to achieve the proper focus on operational problems. To define a problem in some instances, the reviewer need merely talk to operations personnel and then share her/his viewpoints with management. Keep in mind that people in operations are usually more aware of problems and their causes than management personnel. The reviewer's role is also to identify the actual causes (not the symptoms or believed causes) of problems, which may be the result of management policy or actions. Finally, the reviewer must formulate realistic, practical solutions to these problems. This is where the reviewer's experience in working with numerous other departments and/or organizations is valuable. Remember, organizations are always looking for best practices (internal or external) that can be practically implemented in a particular situation as part of a program of continuous improvement. A good rule for the reviewer to follow is not to recommend any course of corrective action that s/he could not assist in implementing.</p>
<h3>2. Locating Opportunities for Eliminating Waste and Inefficiency</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that each dollar of cost reduction (without sacrificing efficiency or effectiveness) contributes dollar-for-dollar to the bottom line. Cost reduction is a significant element in operational reviews. Be wary of short-term cost reductions causing long-term problems (e.g., downsizing of operations and/or personnel when business falls off). It is the role of the reviewer to assist the company to operate at the lowest possible cost in relationship to adequate plans. Costs should always be at the correct level, and when costs need to be cut, proper decisions are made so as not to adversely impact operations. This is in contrast to typical cost cutting across the board, which not only constricts all operations, but also fails to provide for the necessary resources for those operations that actually need increased funds.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>3. Locating Opportunities to Increase Revenues</h3>
<p>Increasing revenues also has an effect on the bottom line, yet only to the extent of profit margins for this additional amount of revenue. Increasing revenues may, in fact, be detrimental in terms of profits and operating efficiencies (both short-term and long-term profits). Often revenues or sales are increased to present a more favorable sales picture in the short term or to fill plant or service capacity, rather than on the basis of sound planning. Please note that in most organizations a greater amount of resources and emphasis is devoted to revenue improvement than to cost economies, even though effective cost cutting offers greater rewards.</p>
<h3>4. Identifying Undefined Organizational Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Procedures</h3>
<p>It would be nice to think that all organizations are doing effective long-term and short-term planning. In reality, this is usually more the exception than the rule. This means that the reviewer will have to assist management in recognizing undefined goals, objectives, and detailed plans and to assist in developing such plans prior to starting the operational review. For without defined plans, there are no yardsticks or milestones against which to measure the organization's effectiveness.</p>
<h3>5. Identifying Criteria for Measuring the Achievement of Organizational Goals</h3>
<p>There is great likelihood that plans and related goals and objectives are not in existence. Even when they do exist, there may not be appropriate criteria for measuring their achievement. The reviewer may have to assist management in the development of such criteria.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>6. Recommending Improvements in Policies, Procedures, and Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>The reviewer may find instances in which the cause of the problem lies with existing policies or procedures. Policies should be set by senior management and relate to the rules by which the organization conducts its business (e.g., service to the customer). Many times, such policies get in the way of operations personnel performing their functions (e.g., excessive controls and paperwork to process a customer credit) or insufficient authority is delegated to allow them to be most effective (e.g., sending a service representative to the customer to investigate a complaint). In these instances, the policies may be wrong and in need of correction.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Procedures are the ways in which functions are performed based on stated policies. As such procedures refer to operations, it might seem that operations personnel would be involved in establishing and implementing such procedures. In most instances, management sets procedures, causing operations personnel to resist them and work against their success.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The organization's structure tends to evolve over a period of time, with minimal regard to economy, efficiency, or effectiveness. In most organizations, there are built-in incentives to increase organizational levels, such as budget systems that reward the growth of organizations and encourage politicking to build empires. It is the reviewer's role to identify such organizational inefficiencies and to recommend improvements. It is then management's responsibility to decide what to do with extraneous personnel, possibly effecting departmental transfers, retraining, lateral moves, and so on. It is usually more desirable to use existing good personnel elsewhere in the organization than to terminate them.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>7. Providing Checks on Performance by Individuals and by Organizational Units</h3>
<p>Assuming that proper results have been defined for individuals and work units, it is the reviewer's responsibility to ensure that adequate checks or measurement criteria have been established to monitor progress towards their achievement. The reviewer must also ascertain that correct performance measures are being used&#8212;not just merely that they exist&#8212;and performance is being compared against them.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>8. Reviewing Compliance With Legal Requirements and Organizational Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Procedures</h3>
<p>The reviewer makes sure that the organization complies with the laws and internal rules under which it performs its functions. If there is a lack of compliance, the reviewer defines the consequences.</p>
<h3>9. Testing for Existence of Unauthorized, Fraudulent, or Otherwise Irregular Acts</h3>
<p>Such testing is normally a requirement for operational reviews, particularly where such acts have an adverse effect on operations.</p>
<h3>10. Assessing Management Information and Control Systems</h3>
<p>The reviewer will address a number of concerns in this area, such as the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Are reporting systems adequate to provide management and operations personnel the information necessary to effectively operate all aspects of the organization?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Is the level of detail commensurate to the level of operations (i.e., more detail at lower levels; less detail at higher levels)?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Is there information lacking that should be present?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Are all key operating indicators being considered (e.g., units shipped as well as items rejected and returned)?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>11. Identifying Possible Trouble Spots in Future Operations</h3>
<p>Many times the reviewer senses a future problem based on troubles in the past. For instance, problems with past computer conversions may indicate future troubles with an extensive computer processing upgrade.</p>
<h3>12. Providing an Additional Channel of Communication Between Operating Levels and Top Management</h3>
<p>In many organizations, there is a clear (or unclear) separation between management and operations; that is, management makes the decisions and operations personnel carry them out. One of the most important benefits of the operational review is the reviewer's ability to convey operational concerns to management in those instances where such concerns are not being communicated on an ongoing basis.</p>
<h3>13. Providing an Independent, Objective Evaluation of Operations</h3>
<p>Both management and operations personnel are often too close to what is going on within their own operations to effectively evaluate their results. The independent operational reviewer can do this objectively, pointing out those areas in need of improvement as well as those that are being performed well.</p>

1 C. Conducting the Operational Review 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Operational Review Process</h2>
<p>Operational reviews consist basically of gathering information, making evaluations, and developing recommendations where appropriate. An operational review is essentially the evaluation of an activity for potential improvement and opportunities to increase profit. Management has the primary responsibility for proper planning, conduct, and control of activities. The way management plans, conducts, and controls the activities becomes a major consideration and focal point in the conduct of the review. In addition, the review includes analyzing results and being alert to problems. The review also provides insights into the effectiveness of management and the potential for improvements.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Specific Purpose</h2>
<p>In conducting an operational review, one should be aware of the purpose for conducting the review. Prior to the start of the operational review, the reviewer should communicate clearly her/his understanding of the purpose(s) to appropriate management personnel. There should be a mutual agreement as to the purpose in the beginning. For example, the purpose could be one or more of the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>To review and evaluate the adequacy of the accounting system and related internal accounting controls (including both accounting and administrative controls)</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>To analyze systems and controls; as related to internal controls, functional operations, and legal compliance</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>To analyze the capability to accomplish agreed-upon stated goals, objectives, and results in management's approved plan</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>To compare actual accomplishments/results with the goals and objectives established in management's plan for the period; and to determine reasons that established goals and objectives were not met</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>To analyze and explain cost overruns or high unit costs for each function/activity for which such data can be quantified</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>To assess and evaluate compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations; ensuring at least minimal compliance</p>
</li>
<li value="7"><p>To identify and report deficiencies and areas for improvement and to provide technical assistance and follow-up where necessary</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Types of Review and Review Phases</h2>
<p>The operational reviewer may perform two types of review: preliminary and in-depth. The difference between the two is the degree of emphasis, the specific techniques chosen, and the objectives of a particular phase. In a preliminary review, fieldwork might consist of limited transaction testing and interviewing. The report may be a briefing to management. In an in-depth review, fieldwork might consist of detailed examination using techniques such as work measurement, workload analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and so on. The report may be formally written, with wider distribution. Each of the two types of reviews has five phases. The operational review phases can be described as follows:</p>
<h3>1. Planning</h3>
<p>The reviewer obtains general information about the kinds of activities performed, the general nature of those activities and their relative importance, and other general information to help plan the early portions of the review.</p>
<h3>2. Work Programs</h3>
<p>The reviewer prepares the operational review work program for the preliminary review of those activities selected for review in the planning phase. Well-constructed work programs are essential for conducting operational reviews in an efficient and effective manner. Such programs must be individualized for each situation, and each work step must state clearly the work to be done and why.</p>
<h3>3. Fieldwork</h3>
<p>The reviewer analyzes operations to determine the effectiveness of management and related controls. Such functions and controls are tested in actual operation, with particular emphasis on areas difficult to control and having high potential for weakness. The purpose of this phase is to determine whether a situation needs improvement, whether it is significant, and what should be done about it.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>4. Development of Findings and Recommendations</h3>
<p>Based on the significant areas identified during the fieldwork phase, specific findings are developed according to the following attributes:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Condition: What did you find?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Criteria: What should it be?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Effect: What is the impact on operations?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Cause: Why did it happen?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Recommendation: What needs to be done to correct the situation?</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>These are based on present best practices and always subject to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. Reporting</h3>
<p>The reviewer prepares the report relative to the results of the review. The purpose of the report is to bring these results to the attention of those having an interest in or responsibility for the findings. In reality, the majority of findings, if not all, should have been reported to management with remedial action already being taken or completed prior to the formal report. The report becomes a summary of the results of the review.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>What Functions to Review</h2>
<p>The most critical question to answer for an organization is what function or functions to include in the operational review. Where shall we review? Do we perform the operational review for all functions of the organization or for only selected areas? A good starting point is to list the organization's major functions, to check off those where operational review would be most helpful, and then to prioritize each function as to its criticalness and/or the desired order of review.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>1. Overall Organizational Operation</h3>
<p>One way to decide which functions to review is to determine how critical each function is to the overall organizational operation. For instance, for a manufacturing business, the most critical area might be the inventory or production control functions. For a service-oriented concern where personnel cost approximate 70 percent of total expenditures, the personnel function would be more critical. Normally, reviewers work with a limited budget in terms of hours allocated to the operational review, so they are greatly concerned with spending these hours on functional areas that offer the greatest potential for operational improvements in return for their effort. Criteria for determining a company's critical areas include the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas with large numbers in relationship to other functions; e.g., such as revenues, costs, percentage of total assets, number of sales, units of production, and personnel</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where controls are weak; e.g., a lack of an effective manufacturing control system, management reporting system, or organizational planning and control system</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas subject to abuse or laxity; e.g., there may be inventory and production controls that allow transactions to go unreported and undetected, uncontrollable time and cost reporting, and ineffective personnel evaluation procedures</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas that are difficult to control; e.g., there may be ineffective storeroom, shipping, or time recording procedures</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where functions are not performed efficiently or economically; e.g., there may be ineffective procedures, duplication of efforts, unnecessary work steps, inefficient use of resources, such as data processing equipment, overstaffing, and excess purchases</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(F)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas indicated by ratio, change or trend analysis; such as characterized by wide up or down when compared over a number of periods. Examples include sales changes by product line, costs by major category, number of personnel, inventory levels, and so forth.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(G)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Areas where management has identified specific weaknesses or needs for such as personnel functions, manufacturing procedures, data processing operations, and management reporting</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>2. Willingness</h3>
<p>Another factor to consider when choosing critical operational areas to review is the willingness of the personnel to cooperate in the performance of the review. First, those in operational management should want to have their operations reviewed and be willing to work with the reviewers in improving their operations. Without such top-management commitment, the operational review is not likely to succeed. Second, staff and operating personnel must be willing to work with the reviewers both in performing the operational review and in the subsequent implementation of operational improvements.</p>
<h3>3. Cooperation</h3>
<p>Cooperation at all levels of the organization is essential to a successful operational review. The reviewer must enlist the cooperation of all personnel; members of management to ensure top commitment to the review, and operations personnel to help in identifying areas to review and proposed improvements. Normally, in most operations, the staff or operating personnel know precisely what is going on day by day, and with firsthand knowledge of operations, can help you to identify the most critical areas to review.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>4. The Budget</h3>
<p>In addressing the number of critical areas to be covered in the operational review, it is important to understand the relationship between budgeted review time and the scope of operational review work to be accomplished. In many situations, the budget hours are established first and then the scope of the operational review is made to fit within the budget. While this procedure may work from an internal standpoint in regard to budget and staffing, it does not fully take into account the aspect of such reviews that require flexibility and expandability of formulated operational review work programs. In addition, it is important for the reviewer and management to consider the cost against the expected benefits of the specific operational review. This is a significant concept in helping to determine how much time to allocate to the operational review. There are a number of factors to consider in establishing the operational review budget. They include the following:</p>
<p><b>(A). The Scope of the Operational Review</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Are all significant operational areas to be reviewed, or only the major ones identified?</p>
<p><b>(B). The Frequency of the Operational Review</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Is the operational review to be done on a one-time basis, which requires more up-front planning and research; or is it to be performed for an area that is reviewed on a regular basis and requires minimal up-front efforts?</p>
<p><b>(C). The Nature of the Business Operations</b> &#160;</p>
<p>For example, a service business dealing primarily with selling staff time, such as a medical, legal, or a CPA practice, would normally require less time for an operational review than a manufacturing business that produces, ships, sells, and services a fairly wide product line.</p>
<p><b>(D). The Degree of Management Effectiveness</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Functional areas that are ineffectively managed will normally require more operational review time than those that are more effectively managed.</p>
<p><b>(E). The Expectation of Benefits</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Those areas that afford the greatest expected benefits, in terms of the number of potential recommendations or savings, should be the areas reviewed first; however, these areas will take more time to review than those with lesser expectations.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b>(F). Cost/Benefit Approach</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Operational reviews, to be most successful, require a large amount of pre-planning, fact gathering, and research. This can make the costs of conducting an operational review considerable. When compared with the potential benefits and savings, costs become less significant. That is why, when determining how much time to spend on the operational review, it is best to use a cost/benefit approach, tempered, of course, with the reality of available staff and hours. Effort should be made to cover competently as many of the major critical areas as possible within limited staffing constraints.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>When performing a financial type audit, the audit group is budgeting staff time and related costs. In effect, the financial audit becomes a cost center. In an operational review, operational benefits and dollar savings should greatly surpass the cost of the review (savings should be at least three times its cost). In effect, the operational review becomes a profit center. Theoretically, the more operational reviews are done, the greater the savings realized by the organization. In reality, some guidelines are needed to establish the extent of an operational review in a given functional area, once the critical areas for the review are identified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. The Initial Survey</h3>
<p>To achieve the greatest results from limited operational review resources, the reviewer identifies those areas of major importance and those offering the greatest potential savings or benefits. The identification of these areas is done as part of an initial survey, either prior to or as part of the planning phase of the operational review. If performed before the planning phase, either because the client requests it (perhaps a small scope or budget), or for some other reason, the survey usually consists of some type of management and operational questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire is to determine what functions are performed, who performs each function, why each is performed, and how each is performed.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p><b>(A). Search for Insight</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Answers to these questions should provide insight into the organization's objectives, activities, work performance, systems and procedures, limits of authority, and so on. The reviewer uses the questionnaire as a guideline and does not rely solely on yes-or-no responses. This is a quick review tool to help identify critical areas for further review where it is not feasible to implement the more desirable but time-consuming, full-planning phase. A survey of this kind should not be used in lieu of the planning phase, as it is still the reviewer's responsibility to substantiate, with adequate evidence, the identification of critical operational areas to be reviewed.</p>
<p><b>(B). Example of Survey</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Exhibit 1.3 is a sample operational review initial survey form. The purpose of the initial survey is to identify areas of major importance in the total organization or specific operations to be reviewed. Improper identification results in spending unnecessary effort on less significant activities and insufficient effort in more important areas. The survey should provide for more detailed answers, rather than simple yes-or-no responses. The same questions are reviewed with various personnel; such as departmental management, functional supervision, and operations and support personnel. The reviewer thus isolates patterns of agreement and disagreement, as well as various interpretations and perceptions that lead to the correct conclusions. Where necessary, each question is supported by available documentation. This form could also be used as part of the more formal planning phase, but should be more specific to a departmental or functional area.</p>

<h2>Engagement Development</h2>
<p>An operational review could be conducted by an external consulting firm, an internal review group, an independent in-house unit, departmental personnel, or a combination of staff from these entities. Whichever organization has primary responsibility for conducting the operational review, the major steps in its development and performance should be similar.</p>
<h3>1. Recognize and Define the Problem</h3>
<p>The first step is to recognize and define the problem. Normally, it is management's prerogative to identify the major problem area or areas to be addressed in an operational review. If requested by management, the reviewer can assist in such problem definition as described previously, or the reviewer may perform a preliminary survey to identify significant operational areas to be reviewed.</p>
<h3>2. Gather Appropriate Data</h3>
<p>The second step is to gather the appropriate supporting data, and is usually accomplished by the operational reviewer. The purpose of this data gathering is to provide background information relative to the problem areas defined, so as to substantiate the problem situation.</p>
<h3>3. Evaluate the Situation</h3>
<p>The next step is to evaluate the situation within the organization to determine such things as the organizational structure and resources available. These are the factors on which the reviewer bases the proposal to management for conducting the operational review.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>4. Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>The reviewer has gathered sufficient background data on the operational problem areas identified for review, and has decided on the plan for conducting the operational review. Now, the reviewer needs to submit a written proposal or engagement letter to clarify for management such considerations as the following:</p>
<table>

<h3>5. External consulting Firm</h3>
<p>An external consulting firm proposing to perform an operational review for a client may have to estimate time and costs before starting an engagement. To do this requires sufficient initial survey work and adequate prior experience on similar engagements to enable the reviewer to estimate accurately. While it is obviously advantageous to estimate the amount of fieldwork required after completion of the planning phase, the client normally wants to know these amounts upfront. The samples provided are for a relatively sizable operational review. In a situation where potential operational review engagements may be smaller in scope, the two phases may be combined and the numbers scaled down.</p>
<h3>6. Internal Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>Although it is usually an external consulting firm that submits a proposal letter to management, it is also good practice for an internal group to submit a similar proposal prior to the start of the operational review engagement. The major purpose of such an internal proposal letter is to ensure clear communication, as to the purpose and scope of the operational review, between the review group and management. In this context, the internal proposal becomes a letter of understanding between the internal review group and management. The contents of the internal proposal letter would differ somewhat from an external proposal, and would only include those areas necessary to the situation.</p>
<h3>7. Sample of Proposal Letter</h3>
<p>An example of an operational review proposal letter is shown in Exhibit 1.4, with an accompanying sample time and cost budget estimates for the conducting of the operational review in Exhibit 1.5. These cost estimates are for the reviewer's use in determining the cost of the engagement and are not given to operations management.</p>
<p>Exhibit 1.4&#8212; Sample Proposal Letter (is available as pdf supplement through this link and Tools).</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Perform the Operational Review</h2>
<p>The proposal letter has been submitted and accepted by management. Now what? Now begins the actual operational review, using the proposed phase approach of planning, work program, fieldwork, development of findings and recommendations, and reporting. Should management request it, the reviewer might help to implement the recommended operational improvements. Otherwise, client personnel may feel confident that they can implement the agreed upon recommendations on their own.</p>
<h3>1. Identify Other Significant Operational Areas</h3>
<p>As part of the reporting process, it is also important to identify other significant operational areas where the operational review approach could offer specific improvements and quantifiable benefits. This could lead to a follow-up operational review engagement for the external consulting firm, particularly if it has proven its worth in the current operational review. For the internal review team, it could result in management's asking for additional operational reviews. Not only is such an approach productive in selling the entire operational review concept, but it also reinforces the concept of the internal review group existing as a &#8220;profit center&#8221; in the conducting of operational reviews. The &#8220;profit center&#8221; concept is based on convincing management that the benefits to be derived from operational reviews far exceed the costs involved. This is where the quantification of findings is extremely important.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h3>2. Client's Personnel</h3>
<p>Another aspect to consider is that if the operational review is performed properly with the help of departmental personnel, the department retains the residual ability to perform operational review procedures in other areas. As the operational review team cannot normally cover every operational area that could be improved within the scope of the original operational review, the team should identify those additional areas for further review and, possibly, for review by the department. Management then decides whether to pursue these areas on their own or with the operational reviewer's help.</p>
<h3>3. Effectiveness of the Reviewer</h3>
<p>One of the goals in acquainting an organization with the operational review approach is to multiply the effectiveness of operational reviewers. In other words, while performing the operational review, reviewers are also training client personnel. In this way, operational review procedures and results are quickly multiplied throughout the organization, and the reviewers can then spend their time on the most significant areas and tasks.</p>

<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Leasing Insurance Costs</h2>
<p>During the course of your operational review procedures, you found that the company was paying for liability and property damage insurance as part of their lease agreement on 14 tractors and 19 trailers. The cost of the insurance was hidden in the fixed weekly/mileage rates billed by the lessor. The company's policy is to self-insure or assume certain risks (such as auto collision and certain other property losses, and the front end of unknown claims such as liability claims) and to purchase protection for any other risks under a blanket policy.</p>

<h3>2. What Happened in Real Life?</h3>
<p>In a &#8220;real life&#8221; version of this particular situation, it was found that lessor insurance costs totaled $39,000 for the year, and that the costs under the company's self-insurance and blanket policy would have been $6,000. Accordingly, an annual savings of $33,000 was realized by reverting back to the self-insurance policy. This situation would be reviewed periodically in the future to ensure that conditions had not changed or that other best practices had come into existence.</p>

1 E. Case Study: Joe Sorry, Inc. 
</div></h1>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Background of Situation</h2>
<p>If the basic purposes for being in business, that is customer service and cash conversion, are understood, how have so many businesses gone astray? To illustrate some of these principles and the application of operational review concepts, let me share the story of one of my consulting clients whom we will call Joe Sorry. Joe was a professional friend of mine working for a large national electronics organization, as a top middle manager, but who wanted to have his own business. He knew he could run a business better than his present employers. He decided he was ready and hired me to assist him in putting his business together.</p>
<p>Joe had been employed by ACE Electronics for nearly 20 years, serving in a number of Engineering and manufacturing positions at various locations. Presently, Joe was assigned as plant engineer to a small division manufacturing specialty printed circuit boards for a select number of customers. The company had always looked at this division as a sharer of overhead, not as a growth profit center. In fact, the division shared manufacturing space with a larger division and was considered a divisional &#8220;step child.&#8221; The company had recently been purchased in a leveraged buyout, and the new owners were going through a program of divestiture and selling off of various divisions and facilities; as well as a program of cost cutting and employee downsizing.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<p>Joe's division was one that the new owners decided to put up for sale. Joe was eager to buy it, since he felt very strongly that with the sale of his division he would be let go. He also believed that he could do a better job of managing and operating the division on a full time basis than was presently being done by the parent company on a &#8220;step child&#8221; type basis. Joe saw good potential for additional sales as the present company mainly treated this division as a specialty house for their existing customers. He also foresaw numerous possibilities for cost savings through production efficiencies. He believed that inefficiently sharing space and manufacturing processes with the main division accomplished present production. In addition, by breaking away from the company, he believed this division could be operated at much less administrative cost and would not have to share the inequitable share of overhead burden allocated to them. Joe had no doubt that he could improve operations dramatically within the first year, and growth possibilities were extremely attractive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Joe chose to purchase and start a business in which he knew something about&#8212;as he had been the plant engineer for his previous employers&#39; electronics business. While he did not know everything there was to know about running a business; such as finance and accounting, sales and marketing, production and inventory control, purchasing, etc.; he knew that in this business (at that time) it was fairly easy to produce a quality product for less than customers were willing to pay for it. He had seen his previous employer making bundles of money (in his terms) from this division in spite of themselves and their gross inefficiencies. He was certain that their internal reporting and allocation systems had made this division look worse than it was and a prime candidate for sale. Joe knew he could do better.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Financing the Business</h2>
<p>Joe had acquired some financial backing (other than his and his wife's savings&#8212;and his children's college fund) from his in-laws. Although Joe had some basic accounting knowledge, he did not have strong financial and accounting skills, but he knew he had to present some kind of projected numbers to acquire the additional financial backing he needed from others. For this purpose, Joe developed the following income statement projection, comparing the last year of ACE Electronics operations (in millions of dollars) with the projected future goals of Joe Sorry Company's operations:</p>

</div>
<p>Based on the above projection, which Joe believed was relatively realistic, Joe performed no further financial studies and his financial backers requested no additional data. Joe believed that through his efforts he would be able to easily meet the targeted increase in sales, decreases in costs of manufacturing and selling and administration, and resultant improvements in profitability. The combination of these factors should be enough to avoid any financial difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Missed Considerations</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Joe's projections proved inadequate. He had not taken into consideration three significant factors:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Investment of over $2 million dollars in plant and equipment to gain all of his projected manufacturing efficiencies. Remember the previous owners operated on a shared plant basis and Joe had to start from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Increase in sales to achieve his sales target from present customers and adding new customers would require increased sales efforts, possible lowering of prices, a more favorable credit terms. The previous owner did not actively look to increase this part of their business, as they saw it as a specialty service to their present customers.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>It would take time (probably at least 3 years) to achieve the projected sales volume of over $500,000 monthly sales to attain the $6,300,000 annual target.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>ACE Electronics Position</h2>
<p>ACE Electronics had enjoyed a unique position in their specialty circuit board division as demand for its products by existing customers exceeded its ability to supply the products. The division was able to sell all of its monthly allocated production quota of about $300,000 on a continuing basis with no real effort. Due to the nature of the specialty of the product to its customers, ACE could require in most cases cash payment at the time of delivery. ACE was also able to dictate delivery schedules that allowed them to intersperse their specialty board manufacturing into idle production slots of the main division. This was basically the concept and philosophy of the specialty board division&#8212;that is to fill in production gaps and assume some of the overhead of the main division.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Joe's Operating Results</h2>
<p>When Joe took over the specialty boards division, the division had reached a plateau of about $300,000 in monthly sales, with operating profits in the 7&#8211;8 percent range. Joe set up an expansion program with a goal of increasing sales by at least 50 percent with an operating profit margin in the 20&#8211;25 percent range. Although Joe did not achieve these goals the first year, by the third year his program was proving successful. His current monthly financial report showed that sales had increased to over $500,000 with over $100,000 in net income as shown below:</p>

<p>As Joe learned, even with the most successful businesses in terms of sales and net income, resources always have their limitations. Since Joe believed he understood the product side of the business, Joe hired us to conduct an operational review of his business to help put the business side together.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Educating the Client</h2>
<p>The first thing Joe wanted explained to him was if he was making so much money, why did the business not have any cash? Obviously, Joe's cash deficit was not due to anything magical, but developed predictably from his normal business operations. I explained a number of things to Joe about accrual accounting versus operational data, mainly:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Sales are recorded when made (goods shipped to the customer); and set up as accounts receivable; with cash being received at the time of payment.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Expenses are made on a different timing schedule from cash receipts. For example, payroll is paid when due, although you may not receive payback via customer sales until sometime in the future (typically over 30 days hence). This is also true of manufacturing costs such as materials and supplies.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Profits shown on the income statement are based on accrual accounting&#8212;that is sales are recorded when made not when accounts receivable are collected, and expenses are recorded as incurred not when they are paid from accounts payable.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Some expenses are handled via accounting entries such as depreciation and amortization, while prepaid items are recorded currently but they represent prior cash disbursements.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Expenditures for fixed assets, inventory, and other &#8220;deferred&#8221; expenses are paid for currently but do not immediately appear on the income statement.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Financial statements do not provide all of the necessary data needed to manage and operate effectively. For instance, the costs and profits generated for each manufacturing order, the number of on-time deliveries, the amount of returned merchandise, the amount and cost of rework, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Based on the above, Joe's profit for the current month of $101,000 turned into a cash deficit of $85,344. This exemplifies the difference between profitability and liquidity, and accrual versus operational reporting. Had Joe understood these principles, he could have avoided such operational problems. We agreed that we would look at the major aspects of Joe's operations during the course of our operational review.</p>

<h2>Preliminary Survey</h2>
<p>As part of the operational review process, it is good practice to meet with the client initially and perform a preliminary review of their operations&#8212;prior to submitting a proposal letter (or internal letter of understanding) as to the scope of the review and related fees. This preliminary review is normally performed at no cost to the client and takes from a half to a full day. It is your means to learn about the client and develop a proposal that incorporates the client's major critical operational areas into the operational review, so that you can provide the greatest benefit to their operations.</p>
<h2>Understanding Basic Business Principles</h2>
<p>I started with Joe by explaining what I considered some basic business principles. Joe generally agreed with these principles although he, like many new business owners, had visions of sugarplums in his head as to having enormous physical plant and employees under his control. He wanted to be automatically large just like his previous employer; making the assumption that more was better. Joe wanted immediate gratification for being the boss and felt he should have the same perquisites as he had before. When I explained to him that when he worked for the large corporation he was spending &#8220;other people's money&#8221; (OPM), and now he was spending his money (OCI or our children's inheritance), he seemed to understand.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Business Background</h2>
<p>While he still wanted the big corporation comforts, he now was not willing to spend his money; for he realized that an unnecessary dollar spent in the business was a dollar out of his pocket. As part of the preliminary survey I talked to Joe to acquire a background of his business and his present position. Joe told me that he initially started his business, after acquiring it from ACE Electronics, in a large garage (that used to be a bicycle repair shop) with low rent. At that time, he and his wife Flo were the only employees. Joe started with three small contracts for specialized printed circuit boards that Joe had developed while previously employed at ACE. He established relationships with four circuit board vendors (after over a dozen turned him down) to provide him with the product as needed.</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>I took a quick look at what Joe was purchasing and realized rather quickly that he was ordering all customized boards. I suggested that Joe standardize his outside needs, and customize his product in-house, which would simplify his material purchasing for himself and his vendors as well as cut his material costs with no substantial increase in his manufacturing costs.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Joe readily accepted this suggestion with the comment &#8220;why didn't I ever think of that?&#8221; This is what is known as a &#8220;free bone,&#8221; that is providing something to the client either before you are engaged or in addition to contracted services. This approach also increases your professional credibility and enhances your image.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Business Operations</h2>
<p>He and Flo initially set up the in-house production flow on large second hand wooden tables. When they needed to meet customer delivery commitments, they would have the vendors deliver the boards and at the same time contract with just the number of individuals (i.e., contract employees) to customize the product. Flo would train the production staff; supervise production, packing, and shipping; and bill the customers. Joe was responsible for engineering, purchasing, and vendor relations, and sales and marketing&#8212;working mainly out of his house and car. As Joe and Flo said in those days &#8220;they were one big happy family.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Business Cycle</h2>
<p>As Joe was able to get more business, the business cycle would continue. The first year Joe worked to build the business, and sticking with specialty and custom circuit boards only, had over $3,000,000 in sales with a reported net profit after Joe and Flo's salaries of about $440,000 (a net profit margin of over 13 percent&#8212;not bad for the first year of any business). He and Flo, of course, were working more than they had in their previous jobs. However, they now had one additional ingredient, ownership, and they were building appreciation in their own business.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>Business Growth</h2>
<p>Fairly quickly the word spread that Joe was providing a proprietary quality product at reasonable cost. Joe was now able to bring in more business than his little &#8220;garage shop&#8221; and he and Flo could handle by themselves. With Joe's initial success, he now believed that he had the business acumen to run any business successfully. Nothing builds incompetence greater than success. The company started to grow and grow and grow. During this period, I would see him every so often and he would tell me how well he was doing&#8212;you know in terms of square feet of production and office space, total sales, amount of backlog, number of employees and total payroll, and so on. I cautioned him not to grow too fast and lose control and those elements that had made him successful initially, but he didn't hear. He was becoming just like his previous employer. I asked Joe what he saw as the problems with his company. He started off telling me how well he was doing, again by the numbers. I stopped him and asked him specifically what was the trouble. After hesitating, he finally admitted that he was so successful, it was driving him crazy&#8212;and Flo was in therapy. They had become one big unhappy dysfunctional family.</p>

<div id="learning-unit">
<h2>The Operational Review Agreement</h2>
<p>After talking with Joe, reviewing his operations, general analysis of the financial statements, review of internal reports and so on; it was agreed that we would review the following functions of the Joe Sorry Company:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>Personnel: both manufacturing and general and administrative, as to number and types of personnel necessary.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Manufacturing operations: such as production and inventory control methods and procedures.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>Product line analysis: looking at sales, cost, and pricing considerations of the various products.</p>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>Profit center concepts: looking at the various businesses such as specialty boards, custom boards, defense business, and basic boards.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><p>Operational reporting considerations: such as key operating indicators (KOI&#39;s), type of reporting, and use of reporting.</p>
</li>
<li value="6"><p>Planning and budget systems: including strategic and long term, organization and departmental short-term planning, detail planning, and effective budget techniques.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Proposal or Confirming Letter</h2>
<p>Based on our agreement with Joe, we submitted a proposal or confirming-type letter (see Exhibit 1.4 and Exhibit 1.5 Proposal Letter Budget Estimate for an example) as Joe had already agreed to have us perform the operational review. Note that if you are an internal auditor, it is still suggested that you submit such a document as a letter of understanding to your internal client. Once agreed upon by the client, this becomes your contract.</p>
