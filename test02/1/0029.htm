<h3>3. The Company</h3>
<p>Operational review results provide the company (i.e., owners, management, and employees) with data necessary for effective resource allocation and the strategic focus for the organization. The operational review process provides for those objective measures to determine the success of the company's internal goals, objectives, and detail plans as well as competitive performance measures. Evaluating the company's performance against stakeholder expectations enables the company to pursue its program of continuous improvement and the road to excellence. Effective operational review procedures encompass both internal and external needs.</p>
<h3>4. The Manager</h3>
<p>Managers who are responsible for an operational area have traditionally maintained the operation as they found it; that is, they primarily accepted the organization, personnel, and functions they inherited. They were not allowed or did not understand how to make their assigned area of responsibility more efficient. Many times, there were systems in effect (such as over-controlling bosses) that prevented such positive changes.</p>
<h3>5. Operational Viewpoint</h3>
<p>The purpose of the operational review is to assist managers and operations personnel to look at their areas of responsibility from an operational viewpoint. What do we mean when we say &#8220;from an operational viewpoint&#8221;? We mean that operations are viewed with an eye to whether one can improve operations to be performed more efficiently, effectively, or economically. Many times, the managers and employees of an operational area are too close to operations, are too resistant to change, are too enmeshed in daily operations, and so on to objectively review their own operations. Since, both internal and external consultants have the fact-finding and diagnostic skills needed to perform such operational reviews, they are frequently asked to do so. In some organizations, a separate unit is formed strictly to perform operational reviews.</p>
