<p>Joe's division was one that the new owners decided to put up for sale. Joe was eager to buy it, since he felt very strongly that with the sale of his division he would be let go. He also believed that he could do a better job of managing and operating the division on a full time basis than was presently being done by the parent company on a &#8220;step child&#8221; type basis. Joe saw good potential for additional sales as the present company mainly treated this division as a specialty house for their existing customers. He also foresaw numerous possibilities for cost savings through production efficiencies. He believed that inefficiently sharing space and manufacturing processes with the main division accomplished present production. In addition, by breaking away from the company, he believed this division could be operated at much less administrative cost and would not have to share the inequitable share of overhead burden allocated to them. Joe had no doubt that he could improve operations dramatically within the first year, and growth possibilities were extremely attractive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Joe chose to purchase and start a business in which he knew something about&#8212;as he had been the plant engineer for his previous employers&#39; electronics business. While he did not know everything there was to know about running a business; such as finance and accounting, sales and marketing, production and inventory control, purchasing, etc.; he knew that in this business (at that time) it was fairly easy to produce a quality product for less than customers were willing to pay for it. He had seen his previous employer making bundles of money (in his terms) from this division in spite of themselves and their gross inefficiencies. He was certain that their internal reporting and allocation systems had made this division look worse than it was and a prime candidate for sale. Joe knew he could do better.</p>
