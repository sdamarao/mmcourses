<h3>3. Deficiencies</h3>
<p>It is important to get this information quickly. The information gathering need not be a long drawn-out process, with laborious readings of manuals and other materials. Time-consuming efforts to show the existence of significant <a title="Glossary Term:Deficiencies" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk809407.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">deficiencies</a> should not be undertaken. If any indications of serious deficiencies are found, the reviewer should document them so that they will be considered in deciding on areas for additional work. This procedure provides for an orderly approach to the planning phase and directs operational review effort to those areas with the greatest payout in terms of significant improvement.</p>
<h3>4. 80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>Remember the 80/20 rule. Its application in this case states that 20&#160;percent of the problems impact 80 percent of the organization, and 80 percent of the problems impact only 20 percent of the organization. The reviewer is advised to chase the elephants, the 20 percent, and not the mice, the 80 percent.</p>
<h3>5. Objectives and Controls</h3>
<p>At the end of the planning phase, the reviewer should have adequate working knowledge of the objectives and controls of the reviewed area. The reviewer should be familiar with the organization: its objectives, its problems, its physical layout, and the relative significance of the various responsibilities it has been assigned or has assumed. This enables the reviewer to determine at the outset how much time is required to perform the remaining phases of the review.</p>
