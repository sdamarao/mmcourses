<h3>3. Businesses Not to Be in</h3>
<p>Once short-term thinking is eliminated, managers realize they are not in the following businesses and decision making becomes simpler:</p>
<p><b>(A). Sales Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Making sales that cannot be collected profitably (sales are not profits until the cash is received and all the costs of the sale are less than the amount collected) creates only numerical growth.</p>
<p><b>(B). Customer Order Backlog Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Logging customer orders is a paperwork process to impress internal management and outside shareholders. Unless this backlog can be converted into a timely sale and collection, there is only a future promise, which may never materialize.</p>
<p><b>(C). Accounts Receivable Business</b> &#160;</p>
<p>Get the cash as quickly as possible, not the promise to pay. Remember, customers are the company's business; keeping them in business is keeping the company in business. Normally, the company has already put out its cash to vendors and/or into inventory. It may even be desirable to get out of the accounts receivable business all together. This is particularly true for small sales where the amount of the sale is less than the cost of billing and collections or where major customers (e.g., 20 percent of all customers equal 80 percent of total sales) are willing to pay at the time of shipping or receipt as part of price negotiations.</p>
