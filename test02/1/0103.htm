<h2>Management Information and Reports</h2>
<p>A fifth category of interest is management information and reports. The reviewer should identify all available management information as well as the nature, content, and timing of all reporting. The reviewer should also look for management information that should be present, but is not. It is extremely important to identify the key operating indicators that management has singled out for reporting purposes and those items subject to exception reporting.</p>
<h2>Problem Areas</h2>
<p>Finally, the reviewer gathers information regarding any problem areas. The reviewer identifies and documents all important problem areas relative to the activities to be reviewed. Areas of major deficiency and those that lend themselves to the greatest improvements are to be emphasized. Remember, these are the items to be pursued in the work program and fieldwork phases. To spend review time most efficiently, it is important to analyze those operational areas with the largest potential payout in terms of improvements. Again, the organization's &#8220;elephants&#8221; should be identified in terms of present problem areas, and the &#8220;mice&#8221; considered only for in-house correction.</p>
