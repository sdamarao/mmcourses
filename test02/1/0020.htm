<h3>2. Helpful Systems</h3>
<p>Operational reviews, together with other techniques, are tools to make these systems helpful as intended and direct organizations toward their goals. Theoretically, organizations should operate in an economic, efficient, and effective manner at all times. If such were the case, operational review techniques would be applied on an ongoing basis; however, with the passage of time, good intentions and initially helpful systems tend to deteriorate. Operational reviews are then necessary to help get the organization back on the right track by pinpointing operational <a title="Glossary Term:Deficiencies" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk809407.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">deficiencies</a>, developing practical recommendations, and implementing positive changes.</p>
<h3>3. Accountability</h3>
<p>Managers at all levels should be held accountable for using the scarce resources entrusted to them to achieve maximum results at the least possible costs. Although management should embrace operational review concepts and apply them as they proceed, this is rarely the case. More typically, management needs to be sold on the value of operational reviews. In selling the benefits of conducting operational reviews, it is important to stress that, unlike other techniques that cost time and money for uncertain results, operational reviews pay for themselves. In effect, the operational review environment becomes a profit center instead of a cost center.</p>
