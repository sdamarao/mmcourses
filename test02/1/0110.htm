<h3>4. Organizational Structure Examples</h3>
<p>Representative top-level organization charts are shown in Exhibits&#160;2.1 and 2.2. This typical structure would fit most organizations. It is based on hierarchical pyramid concepts where the ultimate power starts at the top and is delegated down through the pyramid. This is a military model. Its purpose is to maintain control within the organization through a chain of command that demands obedience from each level of the organization that reports to a higher level. To this day, many organizations still function in this manner, where the purpose for the organizational hierarchy is to police and control those reporting to them to make sure they do their jobs.</p>
<p><b>(A). Policing and Control</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The structure is also set up with the intrinsic message that those in a higher position on the chart know more. Hence, much of their time is spent on reviewing the work of those under them and then having those under them redo it so it looks more like what the manager would do. It is these policing-and-control-review-and-redo processes that make many supervisors and managers superfluous (non-value added) organizational overhead, and often more hindrance than help.</p>
<p><b>(B). Self-Disciplined Employees</b> &#160;</p>
<p>If these non-value-added processes are eliminated, management is strictly limited to necessities, and the organization creates an atmosphere that encourages the motivation of self-disciplined employee behavior, we can eliminate many of these layers of unnecessary organization.</p>
