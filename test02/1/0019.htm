<h2>Management Responsibility</h2>
<p>In many organizations today, top management is grasping for ways to become competitive and maintain market position&#8212;or merely to survive.</p>
<h3>1. Detrimental Systems</h3>
<p>Managers have sensed that many of their organizational systems are detrimental to progress and have held them back. These are the very systems that are supposed to be helpful; for example:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Planning systems (long and short term) that resulted in documented plans but not in actual results</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Budget systems that became costly in terms of allocating resources effectively and controlling costs in relation to results</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Organizational structures that created unwieldy hierarchies, which produced systems of unnecessary policing and control</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Cost accounting structures that obscured true product costs and resulted in pricing that constrained competitiveness</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Management systems that produced elaborate computer systems and reporting without enhancing the effectiveness of operations</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(F)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Sales functions and forecasts that resulted in selling those products, which maximized sales commissions but may not have been the products management desired to sell and produce</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(G)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Operating practices that perpetuated outmoded systems (we've always done it that way) rather than promoted best practices</p>
