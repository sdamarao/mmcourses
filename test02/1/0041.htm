<p><b>(C). Develop Recommendations for Improvement or Further Action</b> &#160;</p>
<p>The nature and extent of recommendations developed in the course of operational reviews vary considerably. In many cases, the reviewer may be able to make specific recommendations. In other cases, further study not within the scope of the review may be required. The reviewer should be continually looking for best practices (both internal and external) in a program for continuous improvements.</p>

<p><span style="text-transform:capitalize;"><b>note</b></span></p>
<p>It seems that operations personnel would be involved in establishing and implementing recommendations. In most instances, such procedures are set by management, causing operations personnel to resist them. This works against them being successful. Organization structure tends to evolve over time, with minimal regard to economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.</p>

<h3>2. Incentives</h3>
<p>In most organizations there are built-in incentives to increase organizational levels such as budget systems that reward larger organizations and politicking to build empires. It is the reviewer's role to identify such organizational inefficiencies and to recommend improvements. When the reviewers do this, they do not put themselves in the position of recommending specific individual cuts. Assuming that the organization's personnel are all good employees (and hiring, orientation, training, and promotion policies and procedures are adequate), the reviewer may recommend achieving desired results with less overall personnel. It is, then, management's responsibility to decide what to do with extraneous personnel; such as departmental transfers, retraining, lateral moves, etc. It is usually more desirable to be able to use existing good personnel somewhere else in the organization, than to terminate them.</p>
