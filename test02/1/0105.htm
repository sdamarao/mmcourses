<h2>Organizational Data</h2>
<p>Organizational data may include such things as copies of organization charts, functional job descriptions, and position charts. The reviewer should be sure to ascertain actual duties, responsibilities, and levels of authority for each individual. Written job descriptions should not be automatically accepted at face value. This could entail talking to selected management and operations personnel and/or having them prepare a description of their perceived job duties and responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Financial Data</h2>
<p>Another source of planning phase information is financial data, such as financial statements over a number of years, budget versus actual reports (present and past), cost of operations by period, revenues year by year by source, cash flow analysis, cost accounting data, and <a title="Glossary Term:Ratio, change, and trend analysis" href="javascript:parent.frames.frame_a.O('g/bk8094028.htm')" style="Color: #0078AE ">ratio, change, and trend analysis</a>.</p>
<h2>Policies and Procedures</h2>
<p>Existing policies and procedures, which should be documented in procedures manuals, policy pronouncements, directives, and regulations, are yet another source of information. For many small organizations, such materials will probably not exist, except in the heads of management personnel. In this case, the reviewer would then interview these persons to determine what they believe to be existing policies and procedures, and then test them to determine whether they are actually being followed.</p>
