<h2>Tour of Facilities</h2>
<p>The first thing I did upon arriving to conduct the planning phase of the operational review at Joe's business, which was now located in a fancy new industrial park in an upward mobile suburban area, was to take a tour of his operations. Joe took me around, proud of what he had accomplished&#8212;over 10,000 square feet of production space with 50 production employees, and 3,000 feet of office space with over 30 employees. I asked Joe to leave and let me mosey around the facilities, while he returned to the crisis of the day. The following is what I found out by walking around and talking with the employees on my own:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
<li value="1"><p>The 50 production employees were separated into 6 teams of seven employees each, with one team member assigned the role of team leader. Although the team leader received a minimal amount of additional pay, not one of them was comfortable exercising their team leader responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li value="2"><p>Each of the 6 teams was assigned a foreperson, who was responsible for pushing and maximizing production. Only one of the forepersons was &#8220;respected&#8221; by her team, and that was only because she left them alone to do their jobs.</p>
</li>
<li value="3"><p>The production teams were divided into 4 groups by type of product. Joe had increased from strictly a producer of specialty boards to a diversified product line as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(A)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Specialty boards for a constant customer base: 1 team</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(B)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Custom boards as requested by customers: 1 team</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(C)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Defense contractors on a contract basis: 2 teams</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(D)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Basic boards on a competitive basis to any and all customers: 2 teams. These basic boards were purchased from an offshore producer, and Joe's employees checked them, provided add-ons, and Joe's identification materials.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(E)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>The other two production employees were a Vice-President of Production responsible for Production Control and Scheduling and an Inventory Control Manager responsible for ensuring that sufficient materials were on-hand to meet production needs. Idle teams due to material stock-outs were forbidden.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(F)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>In addition, I found that there were also 12 additional employees that Joe considered indirect labor or overhead (neither plant nor office). These included the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(1)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Five repair and maintenance employees who were responsible for maintaining equipment and cleaning the facilities in the plant and office&#8212;who appeared to be doing mainly &#8220;busy work.&#8221;</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="td1-li" background=none><p class="p-li">(2)</p></td>
    <td class="td-li" background=none><p>Four packers and shippers, and three receivers. Both units appeared to work sporadically, and at other times got in the way of the production people.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
